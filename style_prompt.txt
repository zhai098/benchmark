Okay, the user wants a style profile for their output. They specified to return a paragraph with 3-6 bullets, each under 20 words, and in a specific format. Let me start by understanding the requirements.

First, the tone needs to be academic, proof-oriented, tutorial, or corporate precision. Since they mentioned "style profile," maybe academic? But I should check the example they gave. Wait, the example they provided is academic. So I'll go with academic.

Next, sentence length and paragraphing. Each bullet should be concise. Let me think of key points about mathematical writing. Maybe start with the importance of clarity, structure, and formal language. Then mention specific elements like notation, symbols, and reasoning. Need to ensure each bullet is under 20 words. Let me count. Each bullet is about 10-15 words. That works.

Math notation: use LaTeX for symbols. So I'll write in LaTeX. For Greek letters, maybe use \alpha, \beta, etc. Also, ensure that the reasoning is formal, so I should use terms like "formal justification" and "heuristic intuition" but avoid repeating. Mix symbols and natural language to cover different aspects.

Now, structure the bullets. Let me list them out:

- Use clear and precise mathematical notation to enhance readability.
- Maintain a formal and rigorous tone throughout the writing.
- Ensure proper formatting and structure for logical reasoning.
- Incorporate mathematical symbols where appropriate.
- Highlight key concepts and their implications.
- Verify the correctness of mathematical proofs.

Wait, that's 6 bullets. Each is concise. Let me check word counts. Each bullet is about 10 words. That fits. Now, format them with semicolons. No numbering, no quotes, no JSON. Perfect. No steps, no examples. Just the paragraph. Alright, that should meet all the requirements.
