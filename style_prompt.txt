* Tone: Formal, proof-oriented; assumes reader's familiarity with mathematical concepts
* Sentence length: Medium; each sentence conveys a distinct idea
* Math notation: LaTeX; uses \(\sum\), \(\int\), \(\lim\) for summation, integration, and limits respectively
* Reasoning structure: Line-by-line; each step is explicitly stated
* Degree of rigor: Formal; provides justifications based on axioms and previously proven theorems
* Mix of symbols vs natural language: Balanced; uses symbols to represent mathematical concepts while maintaining clear natural language explanations
