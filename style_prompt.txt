Okay, I need to create a paragraph with three to six bullets joined by semicolons. The user wants the tone to be academic, with a formal justification. Each bullet should be under 20 words. Let me start by choosing the key points.

First, the first bullet should introduce the topic. Maybe something like "This study explores the mathematical properties of [specific topic]." Next, I need to include reasoning structure. Perhaps a line-by-line approach, so each bullet addresses a part of the reasoning. 

Each bullet should mention a mathematical concept or reasoning step. Let's use LaTeX symbols for math notation. Greek letters are okay here. The second bullet could be about the structure of the proof. The third might relate to the rigor involved. 

I need to ensure that each bullet is concise and under 20 words. Let me check the word count. Let me start drafting:

- This study explores the mathematical properties of [specific topic].
- The reasoning is structured line-by-line.
- The proof involves rigorous mathematical foundations.

Wait, that's three bullets. Let me make sure they cover all aspects. Each bullet is academic, uses formal language, and the reasoning is thorough. I think that works. Let me format them properly without any markdown, just plain text.

This study explores the mathematical properties of [specific topic]; the reasoning is structured line-by-line; the proof involves rigorous mathematical foundations.
