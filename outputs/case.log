  [1] To find the minimum value of \(m\), we can use a greedy approach. Let \(x_{i}^*\) denote the maximum element in \(x_i = (x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{in})\).

We first construct \(x_{ij}\) as follows: \(x_{ij} = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{j1}\}\) for \(i \neq j\). For \(i = j\), we set \(x_{ii} = x_{i}^*\). This satisfies condition 1 since \(x_{ij} = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{j1}\} \geq \max\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij}\}\) and \(x_{ii} = x_{i}^* = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{in}\}\).

Now, we check conditions 2 and 3. For condition 2, note that for each \(i\), there are at most \(m = 1\) index \(k\) such that \(x_{ik} = x_{i}^*\) since \(x_{ik} = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik}\}\) and \(x_{i}^*\) is the maximum element in \(x_i\).

Similarly, for condition 3, for each \(j\), there are at most \(m = 1\) index \(k\) such that \(x_{kj} = x_{j}^*\) since \(x_{kj} = \max\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj}\}\) and \(x_{j}^*\) is the maximum element in \(x_j\).

Therefore, the minimum value of \(m\) that satisfies all given conditions is \(m = 1\).
  [2] Let \( n (\geq 2) \) be a positive integer. We aim to find the minimum \( m \) such that there exist \( x_{ij} \) (for \( 1 \leq i, j \leq n \)) satisfying conditions (1) and (2) in the problem statement.

Condition (1) implies that \( x_{ij} \) is either the maximum among the \( i \)th row or the maximum among the \( j \)th column for all \( i, j \). Let \( R_i = \max_{j} x_{ij} \) and \( C_j = \max_{i} x_{ij} \).

Condition (2) states that for every \( i \), there are at most \( m \) indices \( k \) such that \( x_{ik} = R_i \). Similarly, for every \( j \), there are at most \( m \) indices \( k \) such that \( x_{kj} = C_j \).

We claim that \( m = n \) is a valid solution. Let's prove this by contradiction. Assume that \( m < n \).

For each \( i \), there are \( n \) indices \( k \) such that \( x_{ik} = R_i \). Since there are at most \( m \) such indices, there must exist distinct indices \( i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_p \) (\( p > m \)) such that \( x_{i_1 k_1} = R_{i_1}, \ldots, x_{i_p k_p} = R_{i_p} \) for some indices \( k_1, \ldots, k_p \).

Similarly, for each \( j \), there are \( n \) indices \( l_1, \ldots, l_n \) such that \( x_{l_1 j} = C_j, \ldots, x_{l_n j} = C_j \). Since there are at most \( m \) such indices, there must exist distinct indices \( j_1, \ldots, j_q \) (\( q > m \)) such that \( x_{l_1 j_1} = C_{j_1}, \ldots, x_{l_q j_q} = C_{j_q} \).

Now, consider the indices \( i_1, \ldots, i_p, j_1, \ldots, j_q \). We have \( p + q > 2m \), which contradicts the assumption that there are at most \( 2m \) indices \( (i, j) \) with \( x_{ij} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij} \} \) or \( x_{ij} = \max \{ x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{ij} \} \).

Therefore, \( m = n \) is the minimum possible value for \( m \).

In conclusion, the minimum \( m \) is \( n \).
  [3] Let \( x_{i}^* = \max_{j} x_{ij} \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq n \). We construct \( x_{ij} \) as follows:

1. Set \( x_{ij} = x_{i}^* \) for \( 1 \leq i, j \leq m \).
2. For \( i = m+1, m+2, \ldots, n \), set \( x_{ij} = x_{i}^* \) for \( j \in \{1, 2, \ldots, n\} \setminus \{k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{i-1}\} \), where \( k_1, k_2, \ldots, k_{i-1} \) are the at most \( m-1 \) indices for which \( x_{ik_l} = x_{k_l}^* \) for \( l = 1, 2, \ldots, i-1 \).

Now we show that this construction satisfies the given conditions.

1. For every \( 1 \leq i, j \leq n \), \( x_{ij} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij} \} \) or \( x_{ij} = \max \{ x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{ij} \} \). This follows directly from the construction, since \( x_{ij} = x_{i}^* \) when \( j \) is not one of the \( m \) indices with maximum value for \( i \), and \( x_{ij} = x_{1}^*, x_{2}^*, \ldots, x_{m}^* \) when \( i = 1, 2, \ldots, m \).
2. For every \( 1 \leq i \leq n \), there are at most \( m \) indices \( k \) with \( x_{ik} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik} \} \). This is true by construction, since \( x_{ik} = x_{i}^* \) for at most \( m-1 \) indices \( k \), and \( x_{im} = x_{i}^* \) as well.
3. For every \( 1 \leq j \leq n \), there are at most \( m \) indices \( k \) with \( x_{kj} = \max \{ x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj} \} \). This is also true by construction, since \( x_{kj} = x_{k}^* \) for at most \( m-1 \) indices \( k \), and \( x_{mj} = x_{j}^* \) as well.

Therefore, the minimum \( m \) satisfying the problem statement is \( m = n-1 \).
  [4] To find the minimum value of \(m\), we can use the following approach. For each row \(i\), let \(r_i = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \dots, x_{in}\}\). By condition 1, \(x_{ij} \leq r_i\) for all \(j\). Therefore, the number of indices \(k\) such that \(x_{ik} = r_i\) is at most the number of distinct \(x_{ij}\)'s in row \(i\), which we denote by \(d_i\). Thus, condition 2 is satisfied if \(m \geq \max_i d_i\).

Similarly, for each column \(j\), let \(c_j = \max\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \dots, x_{nj}\}\). By condition 1, \(x_{kj} \leq c_j\) for all \(k\). Therefore, the number of indices \(k\) such that \(x_{kj} = c_j\) is at most the number of distinct \(x_{kj}\)'s in column \(j\), which we denote by \(e_j\). Thus, condition 3 is satisfied if \(m \geq \max_j e_j\).

Since both conditions 2 and 3 depend on the number of distinct elements in each row and column, the minimum value of \(m\) is given by \(m = \max_i d_i = \max_j e_j\).

Therefore, the minimum value of \(m\) is the maximum number of distinct elements in any row or column.
  [5] Let \( n (\geq 2) \) be a positive integer. We aim to find the minimum \( m \) such that there exists \( x_{ij} \) (for \( 1 \leq i, j \leq n \)) satisfying conditions (1)-(3).

To find \( m \), we will construct a sequence of matrices \( X^{(1)}, X^{(2)}, \ldots \) such that \( X^{(k)} \) has \( m_k \) rows and \( n \) columns, and \( X^{(k+1)} \) is obtained from \( X^{(k)} \) by merging rows with identical columns. Let \( m_1 = n \).

For \( k \geq 1 \), suppose \( X^{(k)} \) has been constructed with \( m_k \) rows. Since condition (2) implies that for every \( i \), there are at most \( m_k \) indices \( j \) with \( x_{ij} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij} \} \), there exist distinct \( i_1, i_2, \ldots, i_{m_k+1} \) such that \( x_{i_1j} = \max \{ x_{i_1j}, x_{i_2j}, \ldots, x_{i_{m_k+1}j} \} \) for all \( j \). Merge rows \( i_{m_k+1} \) and \( i_1 \) in \( X^{(k)} \) to obtain \( X^{(k+1)} \) with \( m_{k+1} = m_k - 1 \).

By construction, \( X^{(m)} \) has at most \( m \) rows, and since conditions (1) and (3) are preserved in the merging process, there exists a solution \( x_{ij} \) satisfying conditions (1)-(3) with \( m \) or fewer indices having the maximum value for each row and column.

Therefore, the minimum \( m \) is the number of rows in \( X^{(m)} \).

In conclusion, the minimum \( m \) is the smallest positive integer \( k \) such that \( n^2 > k(k+1) \).
  [6] Let \( n (\geq 2) \) be a positive integer. We aim to find the minimum \( m \) such that there exists \( x_{ij} \) (for \( 1 \leq i, j \leq n \)) satisfying conditions (1) and (2) from the problem statement.

To minimize the number of indices \( k \) with \( x_{ik} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik} \} \), we can assume that \( x_{ij} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij} \} \) for all \( 1 \leq j \leq i \leq n \). This is because if \( x_{ik} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik} \} \), then \( x_{ij} \leq x_{ik} \) for all \( j < k \), and thus \( x_{ij} \) cannot be the maximum for \( j < k \).

Similarly, to minimize the number of indices \( k \) with \( x_{kj} = \max \{ x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj} \} \), we can assume that \( x_{kj} = \max \{ x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{k-1,j}, x_{kj} \} \) for all \( 1 \leq k < j \leq n \). This is because if \( x_{kj} = \max \{ x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj} \} \), then \( x_{ij} \leq x_{kj} \) for all \( i < k \), and thus \( x_{ij} \) cannot be the maximum for \( i < k \).

Now, let us consider the number of indices \( k \) with \( x_{ik} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik} \} \) for a fixed \( i \). Since \( x_{ij} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij} \} \) for all \( j \leq i \), it follows that \( x_{ik} = \max \{ x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik} \} \) if and only if \( x_{i1} = x_{i2} = \cdots = x_{ik} \). Therefore, the number of such indices \( k \) is at most the number of distinct values among \( x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{in} \).

Similarly, the number of indices \( k \) with \( x_{kj} = \max \{ x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj} \} \) for a fixed \( j \) is at most the number of distinct values among \( x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{nj} \).

Thus, the minimum \( m \) such that there exists \( x_{ij} \) satisfying conditions (1) and (2) is at most the maximum number of distinct values among all \( n^2 \) entries \( x_{ij} \).

Therefore, the minimum \( m \) is \( \lceil \max \{ \text{number of distinct values among } x_{11}, x_{12}, \ldots, x_{nn} \} \rceil \).
  [7] Let \( n (\geq 2) \) be a positive integer. The minimum \( m \) such that there exists \( x_{ij} \) (for \( 1 \leq i, j \leq n \)) satisfying conditions (1) and (2) and (3) is \( m = n \).

Proof:

By contradiction, assume \( m < n \). Let \( x_{ij} \) be a valid solution for \( m \). We will construct a new set of \( x'_{ij} \) such that it also satisfies conditions (1) and (2) and (3), but with \( m = n \).

First, let \( x'_{ij} = x_{ij} \) for all \( i \neq j \). Since \( m < n \), there must be at least one index \( k \) for which \( x_{ik} \) is the maximum among \( x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik} \). Let \( x'_{ik} = x'_{kj} = x_{kj} \), where \( j \) is the index different from \( i \) and \( k \).

Now, consider condition (1). For every \( 1 \leq i, j \leq n \), \( x'_{ij} = x_{ij} \) or \( x'_{ij} = x_{kj} = x_{kj} = \max \{ x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj} \} \) (since \( j \neq i \)). Also, \( x'_{kj} = x_{kj} = \max \{ x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj} \} \). Therefore, condition (1) is satisfied.

Next, consider condition (2). For every \( 1 \leq i \leq n \), there are at most \( n \) indices \( k \) such that \( x'_{ik} = \max \{ x'_{i1}, x'_{i2}, \ldots, x'_{ik} \} \). Since \( x'_{ik} = x_{ik} \) for all \( i \neq k \), and \( x_{ik} \) is the maximum among \( x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik} \), it follows that \( x'_{ik} = \max \{ x'_{i1}, x'_{i2}, \ldots, x'_{ik} \} \) for all \( i \neq k \). Moreover, \( x'_{in} = x_{in} \), and since there are at most \( m = n-1 \) indices \( k < n \) such that \( x_{ik} \) is the maximum among \( x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik} \), it follows that \( x'_{in} = x_{in} \) is not the maximum among \( x'_{i1}, x'_{i2}, \ldots, x'_{in} \). Therefore, condition (2) is satisfied with equality.

Finally, consider condition (3). For every \( 1 \leq j \leq n \), there are at most \( n \) indices \( k \) such that \( x'_{kj} = \max \{ x'_{1j}, x'_{2j}, \ldots, x'_{kj} \} \). Since \( x'_{kj} = x_{kj} \) for all \( j \neq k \), and \( x_{kj} \) is the maximum among \( x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj} \), it follows that \( x'_{kj} = \max \{ x'_{1j}, x'_{2j}, \ldots, x'_{kj} \} \) for all \( j \neq k \). Moreover, \( x'_{1j} = x_{1j} \), and since there are at most \( m = n-1 \) indices \( k \neq 1 \) such that \( x_{kj} \) is the maximum among \( x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj} \), it follows that \( x'_{1j} \) is not the maximum among \( x'_{1j}, x'_{2j}, \ldots, x'_{nj} \). Therefore, condition (3) is satisfied with equality.

Thus, we have constructed a valid solution \( x'_{ij} \) for \( m = n \), which contradicts our assumption that \( m < n \) is the minimum. Therefore, \( m = n \) is the minimum.
  [8] To prove that $m = 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ is the minimum value satisfying the conditions, we will construct a counterexample for $m-1$ and show that it violates the problem statement.

Assume for contradiction that there exists a solution for $m-1$. Let $x_{ij}$ be such a solution. Since $m-1 < 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$, there must exist at least one row or column with more than $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ indices having the maximum value.

Without loss of generality, assume that there are more than $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ indices $k$ in some row $i$ such that $x_{ik} = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ik}\}$. Let $r = \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil + 1$ be the number of indices in this row with the maximum value.

Now consider the indices $j_1, j_2, \ldots, j_r$ in column $i$ corresponding to these maximum values. Since $x_{ij_k} = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij_k}\}$, we have $x_{ij_k} \geq x_{i1}$ for all $k$.

Since there are only $n$ elements in total, there must exist two distinct indices $k_1$ and $k_2$ such that $j_{k_1} = j_{k_2}$. This means that $x_{i,j_{k_1}} = x_{i,j_{k_2}}$, but both $x_{i,j_{k_1}}$ and $x_{i,j_{k_2}}$ are maximum values in their respective columns.

However, this contradicts condition (1), as $x_{i,j_{k_1}} = x_{i,j_{k_2}}$ cannot both be the maximum value in their respective columns. Therefore, our assumption that there exists a solution for $m-1$ must be false.

Thus, $m = 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ is the minimum value satisfying the conditions.
  [9] To prove that $m = 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ is the minimum value satisfying the problem conditions, we will show that for any $m < 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$, there exists a counterexample.

Assume for contradiction that there exists an $m < 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ such that conditions (1)-(3) hold for some $x_{ij}$.

Since $m < 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$, there exists an integer $k$ with $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil < k \leq n$ such that $m < 1 + k$.

Consider the $n \times n$ matrix $A$ with entries $a_{ij} = \delta_{ij} + \epsilon$, where $\delta_{ij}$ is the Kronecker delta and $\epsilon > 0$ is a small enough constant.

Now, define $x_{ij}$ as follows:
\begin{align*}
x_{ij} = \begin{cases}
a_{ii} + \epsilon, & \text{if } i = j \\
a_{jj}, & \text{if } i \neq j \text{ and } j \leq k \\
a_{ik}, & \text{if } i \neq j \text{ and } j > k \text{ and } x_{ij} = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij}\} \\
a_{kj}, & \text{if } i \neq j \text{ and } j > k \text{ and } x_{kj} = \max\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj}\} \\
a_{11}, & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}
\end{align*}

It is straightforward to check that conditions (1) and (2) hold for $x_{ij}$ since $k < \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil + 1$. However, condition (3) is violated because there are more than $m$ indices $k$ with $x_{kj} = \max\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{kj}\}$ for any fixed $j > k$.

Therefore, $m = 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ is the minimum value satisfying the problem conditions.

In conclusion, the minimum value of $m$ is $1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$.
  [10] To prove that $m = 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ is the minimum value satisfying the problem conditions, we will construct a valid solution with this value of $m$. Let $n$ be a positive integer.

For each $i$ from $1$ to $n$, we define $x_{ii} = i$. Now, for every $j \neq i$, we set $x_{ij} = x_{ji} = \max\{i,j\}$. With this definition, we have that for every $i$ and $j$, either $x_{ij} = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij}\}$ or $x_{ij} = \max\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{ij}\}$.

Let's check condition 2. For every $i$, there are $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ indices $j$ such that $x_{ij} = \max\{x_{i1}, x_{i2}, \ldots, x_{ij}\}$. These are the indices $j$ with $j \leq i$. Since there are $n$ indices in total, there are at most $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ indices $j$ satisfying this condition for each $i$.

Similarly, for every $j$, there are $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ indices $i$ such that $x_{ij} = \max\{x_{1j}, x_{2j}, \ldots, x_{ij}\}$. These are the indices $i$ with $i \leq j$. Again, since there are $n$ indices in total, there are at most $\left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ indices $i$ satisfying this condition for each $j$.

Therefore, the given value of $m = 1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$ satisfies the problem conditions, and it is the minimum possible value for $m$.

In conclusion, the minimum value of $m$ is $1 + \left\lceil\frac{n}{2}\right\rceil$.

  [1] Since \(AD, BE, CF\) are the altitudes of triangle \(ABC\), point \(H\) is the orthocenter. By the orthocenter property, \(AH\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\), \(BH\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(AC\), and \(CH\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(AB\).

Let \(M\) and \(N\) be the midpoints of \(BC\) and \(AC\), respectively. Since \(AH\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(BC\), \(AM\) is the median from \(A\) to \(BC\). Similarly, \(BN\) is the median from \(B\) to \(AC\).

By the Triangle Median Theorem, \(AM = \frac{1}{2}BC\) and \(BM = \frac{1}{2}AC\). Since \(AH\) is also the bisector of the angle between \(BC\) and \(AC\), \(AH\) divides \(MN\) in the ratio of the lengths of the corresponding medians: \(AH:MN = AM:BM\).

Thus, \(AH:MN = \frac{1}{2}BC:\frac{1}{2}AC = \frac{BC}{AC}\). Since \(HQ\) is a segment on \(MN\) with length \(HQ = HM + MN\), we have:

\[
\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{HQ}{AH + HM} = \frac{HQ}{AH + \frac{1}{2}AC + \frac{1}{2}BC} = \frac{HQ}{\frac{1}{2}(AC+BC) + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{BC}{AC}\cdot AC}
\]

Using the Law of Cosines and the fact that \(ABC\) is acute scalene, we have \(BC^2 = AC^2 + AB^2 - 2AC\cdot AB\cdot\cos(A)\). Since \(\cos(A) < 0\) for an acute angle \(A\), we have:

\[
\frac{BC}{AC} = \frac{\sqrt{AC^2 + AB^2 - AC\cdot AB\cdot\cos(A)}}{AC} = \frac{\sqrt{AC^2 + AB^2 - (AC\cdot AB\cdot\cos(A) + AC^2)}}{AC} = \frac{\sqrt{AB^2 - AC^2\cdot\cos(A)}}{AC}
\]

Substituting this expression into the previous equation, we get:

\[
\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{HQ}{\frac{1}{2}(AC+BC) + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{\sqrt{AB^2 - AC^2\cdot\cos(A)}}{AC}\cdot AC} = \frac{HQ}{\frac{1}{2}(AC+BC) + \frac{1}{2}\cdot\sqrt{1-\cos^2(A)}\cdot AC}
\]

Since \(AC > BC\) and \(0 < \cos(A) < 1\), we have \(\sqrt{1-\cos^2(A)} > 1\). Therefore, \(\frac{HQ}{HR} < \frac{HQ}{\frac{1}{2}(AC+BC) + \frac{1}{2}\cdot AC} = \frac{2HQ}{AC+BC}\).

Since \(AP\perp EF\) and \(HQ\perp EF\), quadrilateral \(APHQ\) is a rectangle. Thus, \(AH = HQ\). Therefore, \(HQ = AP = \frac{1}{2}EF\). Substituting this expression into the inequality, we get:

\[
\frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{EF}{AC+BC} < \frac{HQ}{HR} < \frac{EF}{AC+BC}
\]

Solving for \(HQ/HR\), we get:

\[
\boxed{\frac{HQ}{HR} < \frac{1}{2}\cdot\frac{EF}{AC+BC}}
\]

Since \(AP \perp EF\) and \(HQ \perp EF\), we have \(AH \perp EF\) as well (alternate interior angles). By the Pythagorean theorem, we have:

\begin{align*}
AH^2 &= AD^2 + DP^2 \\
AH^2 &= AE^2 + EP^2 \\
AH^2 &= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2(1-\frac{EF^2}{4(AE^2+EP^2)})
\end{align*}

Since \(AP \perp EF\) and \(AP\) is an altitude, \(AP = AD\). Similarly, \(HQ = HE = CF\). By the Law of Cosines, we have:

\begin{align*}
AE^2 &= AC^2 + CE^2 - 2AC\cdot CE\cdot\cos A \\
EF^2 &= EF^2 + FB^2 - 2EF\cdot FB\cdot\cos C
\end{align*}

Substituting \(CE = BE\), \(FB = BC\), and \(\cos A = \frac{BD}{AC}\), we get:

\begin{align*}
AH^2 &= AD^2 + DP^2 \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2(1-\frac{EF^2}{4(AE^2+EP^2)}) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2(1-\frac{EF^2}{4(AE^2+EP^2)}) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(1-\frac{(EF^2+AE^2-AC^2-BE^2+2AE\cdot BE\cdot\cos C)}{4(AE^2+EP^2)}\right) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{AC^2+BE^2-AE^2-EF^2+2AE\cdot BE\cdot\cos C}{4(AE^2+EP^2)}\right) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{(AD+BE)^2-AD^2-BE^2}{4(AE^2+EP^2)}\right) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{(AD+BE)^2-AD^2-BE^2}{4(AD^2+DP^2+BE^2+DP^2)}\right) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{(AD+BE)^2-(AD^2+DP^2+BE^2+DP^2+2AD\cdot BE)}{4(AD^2+DP^2+BE^2+DP^2)}\right) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{(AD-DP)^2+2AD\cdot BE+BE^2-DP^2}{4(AD^2+DP^2+BE^2+DP^2)}\right)
\end{align*}

Since \(AP \perp EF\), we have \(AD\cdot EP = 0\), and since \(AD\) is an altitude, we have \(AD = \frac{BC\cdot AF}{2}\). Substituting these values, we get:

\begin{align*}
AH^2 &= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{(BC\cdot AF/2+BE)^2+BE^2-DP^2}{4(AD^2+DP^2+BE^2+DP^2)}\right) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{(BC\cdot AF/2+BE)^2+BE^2-EP^2(1+\tan^2 C)}{4(AD^2+DP^2+BE^2+DP^2)}\right) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{(BC\cdot AF/2+BE)^2+BE^2-EP^2(1+\tan^2 C)}{AD^2+DP^2+BE^2+DP^2+EP^2(1+\tan^2 C)}\right) \\
&= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{(BC\cdot AF/2+BE)^2+BE^2-EP^2(1+\tan^2 C)}{AH^2-AH\cdot EP\cdot\tan C}\right)
\end{align*}

Since \(AH\cdot EP = AD\cdot BE = BC\cdot AF\), we have:

\begin{align*}
AH^2 &= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2\left(\frac{(BC\cdot AF/2+BE)^2+BE^2-EP^2(1+\tan^2 C)}{AH^2-BC\cdot AF\cdot\tan C}\right) \\
AH^2(1+BC\cdot AF\cdot\tan C) &= AE^2 + EF^2/2 + EP^2((BC\cdot AF/2+BE)^2+BE^2-EP^2(1+\tan^2 C))
\end{align*}

Solving for \(AH^2\), we get:

\begin{align*}
AH^2 &= \frac{AE^2+EF^2/2+EP^2((BC\cdot AF/2+BE)^2+BE^2-EP^2(1+\tan^2 C))}{1+BC\cdot AF\cdot\tan C} \\
AH^2 &= \frac{AE^2+EF^2/2+EP^2(BE^2+BC^2\cdot AF^2/4-EP^2\tan^2 C-EP^2)}{1+BC\cdot AF\cdot\tan C} \\
AH^2 &= \frac{AE^2+EF^2/2+EP^2(BE^2+BC^2\cdot AF^2/4-EP^2\tan^2 C)}{1+BC\cdot AF\cdot\tan C} \\
AH^2 &= \frac{AE^2+EF^2/2+EP^2(BE^2+BC^2\cdot AF^2/4-EP^2\tan^2 C)}{AF\cdot BC\cdot\tan C+AF\cdot BE} \\
AH^2 &= \frac{AE^2+EF^
  [3] Using the given information, we can construct the following diagram:

\begin{figure}[h]
\centering
\includegraphics[scale=0.5]{triangle_orthocenter.png}
\caption{Diagram of the given triangle and its orthocenter, altitudes, and points \(P\) and \(Q\).}
\end{figure}

By the properties of perpendicular lines, we have:
\[AP \perp EF \quad \text{and} \quad HQ \perp EF \quad \Rightarrow \quad AP \parallel HQ.\]

Since \(AP\) is an altitude and \(P\) lies on \(EF\), we have:
\[AP = AD = \frac{BD}{2} \quad \text{and} \quad EP = \frac{EC}{2}.\]

Similarly, since \(HQ\) is an altitude and \(Q\) lies on \(EF\), we have:
\[HQ = HF = \frac{FH}{2}.\]

Using the fact that \(AP \parallel HQ\) and the given lengths, we can apply the Pythagorean theorem to triangles \(APD\) and \(HQF\):

\[AP^2 + PD^2 = AD^2 \quad \text{and} \quad HQ^2 + FR^2 = HF^2.\]

Substituting the expressions for \(AP\) and \(HQ\), we obtain:
\[\left(\frac{BD}{2}\right)^2 + PD^2 = \left(\frac{BD}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{DF}{2}\right)^2,\]

which simplifies to:
\[PD^2 = \left(\frac{DF}{2}\right)^2.\]

Similarly, we have:
\[\left(\frac{FH}{2}\right)^2 + FR^2 = \left(\frac{FH}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{FG}{2}\right)^2,\]

which simplifies to:
\[FR^2 = \left(\frac{FG}{2}\right)^2.\]

Now, we can use the Law of Cosines to find the length of \(FR\) in terms of \(BD\) and \(DC\):
\[FR^2 = \left(\frac{BD}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{DC}{2}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{BD}{2}\sqrt{1+\frac{c^2}{b^2}}\right)^2,\]

where \(b=BD\), \(c=DC\), and \(a=AB\).

Since \(ABC\) is an acute scalene triangle, we have \(a > b > c\). Thus, we can apply the Law of Sines to find \(DC\) in terms of \(BD\) and \(AC\):
\[\frac{DC}{\sin{\angle C}} = \frac{c}{2R_a},\]

where \(R_a\) is the inradius.

Since \(AP\) is the altitude from \(B\) and \(HQ\) is the altitude from \(C\), we have:
\[\sin{\angle A} = \frac{BD}{2R_a} \quad \text{and} \quad \sin{\angle C} = \frac{DC}{2R_a}.\]

Substituting these expressions into the previous equation, we obtain:
\[\frac{DC}{\sin{\angle C}} = \frac{c}{2R_a} \quad \Rightarrow \quad DC = \frac{c\sin{\angle A}}{2\sin{\angle C}}.\]

Substituting this expression for \(DC\) into the equation for \(FR^2\), we get:
\[FR^2 = \left(\frac{BD}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{c\sin{\angle A}}{2\sin{\angle C}}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{BD}{2}\sqrt{1+\frac{c^2}{b^2}}\right)^2.\]

Now, we can find the ratio \(\frac{HQ}{HR}\):
\[\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{HF}{HR} \cdot \frac{HQ}{HF} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{FR}{HR}.\]

Using the fact that \(HR = HF + FR\) and the expression for \(FR^2\) derived above, we have:
\[\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{FR}{HF + FR} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{FR}{2\left(\frac{FH}{2}\right)} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{FR}{FH}.\]

Substituting the expression for \(FR^2\) into this equation, we obtain:
\[\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\left(\frac{BD}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{c\sin{\angle A}}{2\sin{\angle C}}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{BD}{2}\sqrt{1+\frac{c^2}{b^2}}\right)^2}}{FH}.\]

Since \(FH = AF = BC\sin{\angle A}\), we have:
\[\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{1}{2} \cdot \frac{\sqrt{\left(\frac{BD}{2}\right)^2 + \left(\frac{c\sin{\angle A}}{2\sin{\angle C}}\right)^2 - \left(\frac{BD}{2}\sqrt{1+\frac{c^2}{b^2}}\right)^2}}{BC\sin{\angle A}}.\]

This is the final expression for \(\frac{HQ}{HR}\).
  [4] Since \(H\) is the orthocenter of \(\triangle ABC\), it is also the circumcenter of \(\triangle DEF\) due to the Perpendicular Bisector Theorem. Thus, \(HR\) is the perpendicular bisector of \(EF\), and \(HQ\) is a radius of the circumcircle of \(\triangle DEF\). Therefore, we have \(HQ = \frac{1}{2}DE\).

Similarly, \(A\) is the incenter of \(\triangle ABC\), so \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle A\) in \(\triangle DEF\). Let \(M\) be the midpoint of \(EF\). By the Angle Bisector Theorem, \(AM\) is perpendicular to \(EF\) and \(DM\) is the median from \(D\) to the side \(EF\). Since \(AP\) is also perpendicular to \(EF\), we have \(AP = DM\).

By the Median-Altitude Theorem, \(DM = \frac{1}{2}HE\). Therefore, \(AP = \frac{1}{2}HE\), and we can write \(HE = 2AP\).

Now, we use the Law of Cosines to find the length of \(DE\):

\[DE^2 = DC^2 + CE^2 - 2DC \cdot CE \cos \angle DEC\]

Since \(D\) and \(C\) are on the circumcircle of \(\triangle ABC\), \(DC = R \cdot \cos \frac{A}{2}\) and \(CE = R \cdot \sin \frac{A}{2}\). Also, \(\angle DEC = \angle A\) since \(AP\) is an altitude of \(\triangle ABC\) and \(AP \perp EF\). Therefore,

\[DE^2 = R^2 \cdot (\cos^2 \frac{A}{2} + \sin^2 \frac{A}{2}) - 2R^2 \cdot \cos \frac{A}{2} \cdot \sin \frac{A}{2} \cos \angle A\]

Using the identity \(\sin^2 \frac{A}{2} + \cos^2 \frac{A}{2} = 1\), we simplify:

\[DE^2 = R^2 \cdot (1 - \sin \angle A \cdot \cos \angle A)\]

Since \(\triangle ABC\) is acute, \(\sin \angle A > 0\) and \(\cos \angle A > 0\), so \(DE^2 > 0\). Therefore, \(DE\) is a positive length.

Now, we can find \(HQ/HR\):

\[\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{HQ}{DE/2} = \frac{2HQ}{DE}\]

Substituting \(HQ = \frac{1}{2}DE\), we obtain:

\[\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{1}{2}\]

Therefore, \(HQ/HR = \frac{1}{2}\).
  [5] Since \(H\) is the orthocenter of \(\triangle ABC\), it follows that \(AH\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle A\). Thus, \(HR\) is the median from \(H\) to side \(EF\), and \(HR = \frac{1}{2}EF\) by the Median-Altitude Theorem.

Moreover, \(R'\) is the reflection of \(Q\) over \(H\), so \(R'Q = RQ\) and \(HR' = HR\). Therefore, \(HQ = HR + RQ = \frac{1}{2}EF + RQ\).

In \(\triangle HQR\), we have \(HR = \frac{1}{2}EF\) and \(HQ = \frac{1}{2}EF + RQ\). Applying the Pythagorean theorem in right triangle \(HRQ\) yields:

\[(HQ)^2 = \left(\frac{1}{2}EF\right)^2 + (RQ)^2 \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{HQ}{HR} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{2RQ}{EF}\right)^2}.\]

Since \(AP \perp EF\) and \(HQ \perp EF\), we have \(AP \parallel HQ\), and point \(R\) lies on the perpendicular bisector of \(EF\). Thus, \(R\) is the midpoint of \(EF\), and \(RQ = \frac{1}{2}EF\). Substituting this into the previous equation, we obtain:

\[\frac{HQ}{HR} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{2RQ}{EF}\right)^2} = \sqrt{1 + \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^2} = \sqrt{\frac{5}{4}} = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}.\]

Therefore, \(HQ/HR = \frac{\sqrt{5}}{2}\).
  [6] Since \(R' = R\), point \(R\) lies on the line through \(D\) and the midpoint \(M\) of segment \(EF\). By the Midpoint Theorem, \(EM =MF\). In \(\triangle AEF\), \(\angle AEF = 180^\circ - (\angle A + \angle E)\), where \(\angle A\) and \(\angle E\) are the angles opposite sides \(AF\) and \(AE\), respectively. Since \(ABC\) is acute scalene, \(\angle A > \angle E\), so \(\angle AEF < 180^\circ\).

Let \(OM\) be the angle bisector of \(\angle A\) in \(\triangle AEF\), intersecting \(AF\) at \(N\). Since \(OM\) is the bisector of \(\angle A\), \(AN = AF/2\). Also, since \(AD\) is the altitude of \(\triangle AEF\) through \(A\), \(AD = AF \cdot \tan(\angle A/2)\). Thus, \(AN = AF/2 \implies AN = AD/2\tan(\angle A/2)\).

In \(\triangle AHR\), \(\angle AHR = \angle AEF\) because they are corresponding angles. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, \(AH/HR = \tan(\angle A/2)\). Substituting \(AN = AD/2\tan(\angle A/2)\), we have \(AH = AN \cdot HR \implies HR = \frac{AD}{2\tan(\angle A/2}}\).

Finally, we can find the ratio \(\frac{HQ}{HR}\):
\begin{align*}
\frac{HQ}{HR} &= \frac{HQ}{AD/2\tan(\angle A/2)} \\
&= \frac{2\tan(\angle A/2) \cdot HQ}{AD} \\
&= \frac{2\tan(\angle A/2) \cdot \text{inradius of }\triangle DEF}{AD} \\
&= \frac{2\tan(\angle A/2) \cdot \frac{EF}{2}}{AD} \\
&= \frac{\tan(\angle A/2) \cdot EF}{AD}
\end{align*}

Therefore, \(\boxed{\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{\tan(\angle A/2) \cdot EF}{AD}}\).
  [7] In an acute scalene triangle $ABC$, points $D, E, F$ are on sides $BC, CA, AB$, respectively, such that $AD \perp BC$, $BE \perp CA$, $CF \perp AB$. The altitudes $AD$, $BE$, $CF$ meet at the orthocenter $H$. Points $P$ and $Q$ lie on $EF$ with $AP \perp EF$ and $HQ \perp EF$. Let $R$ be the intersection point of lines $DP$ and $QH$.

Since $H$ is the orthocenter, $AD$, $BE$, and $CF$ are the altitudes of $\triangle DEF$. As $H$ is also the incenter of $\triangle ABC$, $H$ is the center of the inscribed circle of $\triangle ABC$. By the Inscribed Circle Theorem, $AD = BC \tan \frac{B}{2}$, $BE = CA \tan \frac{A}{2}$, and $CF = AB \tan \frac{C}{2}$.

Since $AP \perp EF$, $AP$ is a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\triangle DEF$. Let $O$ be the center of this circle. Since $O$ is the midpoint of $EF$, $O$ lies on the median from $E$ to $F$. By the Angle Bisector Theorem, $AH$ is the angle bisector of angle $DEF$, so $AH \perp BE$.

Since $HQ$ is a radius of the inscribed circle of $\triangle DEF$, $HQ = OE = \frac{1}{2}EF$. Since $AP$ is a diameter, $AP = 2O$. Thus, $AP = 2O = 2\left(\frac{1}{2}EF\right) = EF$.

Since $AP \perp EF$ and $HQ \perp EF$, $AP$ and $HQ$ are perpendicular to $EF$. By the Pythagorean theorem, $AH^2 + HQ^2 = AP^2$. Substituting $AH = BC \tan \frac{B}{2}$, $AP = EF$, and $HQ = \frac{1}{2}EF$, we have:

$$(BC \tan \frac{B}{2})^2 + (\tfrac{1}{2}EF)^2 = (EF)^2$$

Simplifying, we get:

$$(BC \tan \frac{B}{2})^2 + (\tfrac{1}{4}EF^2) = (\tfrac{1}{2}EF)^2$$

Multiplying both sides by 4 to eliminate the fractions, we get:

$$4(BC \tan \frac{B}{2})^2 + EF^2 = EF^2$$

Subtracting $EF^2$ from both sides, we get:

$$3(BC \tan \frac{B}{2})^2 = 0$$

Since $BC > 0$, it follows that $\tan \frac{B}{2} = 0$. Therefore, $\frac{B}{2} = 0$, so $B = 0$, which is a contradiction in a triangle.

Thus, our assumption that $AP \perp EF$ and $HQ \perp EF$ implies that points $P$ and $Q$ lie on a single line. Since $R$ is the intersection point of $DP$ and $QH$, it follows that $R$ lies on both $DP$ and $QH$.

Let $M$ be the midpoint of $EF$. Since $AP$ is a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\triangle DEF$, $AP$ is also a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\triangle DEM$. Let $S$ be the circumcenter of $\triangle DEM$. Since $AP$ is a diameter, $AS = SM = ME = \frac{1}{2}EF$.

Since $AP$ is an altitude of $\triangle DEF$, $AP$ is also an altitude of $\triangle DEM$. Let $O'$ be the circumcenter of $\triangle DEF$. Since $AH$ is an angle bisector of angle $DEF$, $AH$ is also an angle bisector of angle $DEM$.

Since $AH$ is an altitude and an angle bisector, $AH$ is the perpendicular bisector of $EF$. Thus, $AH$ passes through the midpoint $M$ of $EF$. Since $AH$ is also a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\triangle DEM$, $AH = SM$.

Since $AH = SM$ and $SM = ME$, it follows that $AH = ME$. Since $AH$ is an altitude of $\triangle ABC$ and $AH = ME$, $AH$ is also an altitude of $\triangle ABM$.

Since $AH$ is an altitude of $\triangle ABM$ and $R$ is the intersection point of $DP$ and $QH$, $R$ lies on $AH$. Since $AH$ is also a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\triangle DEM$, $AH$ bisects angle $DEM$.

Since $AH$ bisects angle $DEM$, angle $DRM = \angle DEM$. Since $AP$ is a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\triangle DEF$, angle $APF = \angle DEF$. Since $AP$ is also a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\triangle DEM$, angle $APM = \angle DEM$.

Thus, $\angle APF = \angle APF + \angle APM = \angle APF + \angle DRP + \angle RPM = \angle APF + \angle DRP + \angle RMQ + \angle QMH + \angle HQM = \angle APF + \angle DRP + \angle RMQ + \angle HQM + \angle MHQ = \angle APF + \angle DRP + \angle RMQ + \frac{1}{2}(\angle DEF + \angle FDE) + \angle HQM$.

Since $\angle APF = \angle HQM = 90^\circ$, it follows that $\angle DEF + \angle FDE = 180^\circ$. Since $\angle DEF + \angle FDE = 180^\circ$, $\triangle DEF$ is a straight angle.

Since $\triangle DEF$ is a straight angle, $EF$ is a diameter of $\triangle ABC$. Since $H$ is the orthocenter of $\triangle ABC$ and $H$ lies on $AH$, $H$ lies on the diameter $EF$.

Since $H$ lies on the diameter $EF$, $HQ$ is a radius of the circle circumscribed around $\triangle ABC$. Thus, $HQ = RH$.

Therefore, $\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{HQ}{HQ} = 1$.
  [8] In an acute scalene triangle \(ABC\), points \(D, E, F\) are on sides \(BC\), \(CA\), \(AB\), respectively, with \(AD \perp BC\), \(BE \perp CA\), \(CF \perp AB\). Let \(H\) be the orthocenter, \(P\) and \(Q\) be on \(EF\) with \(AP \perp EF\) and \(HQ \perp EF\), and \(R\) be the intersection of \(DP\) and \(QH\).

Since \(H\) is the orthocenter, \(AD\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle BAC\), \(BE\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle ACB\), and \(CF\) is the angle bisector of \(\angle CAB\). Therefore, \(AH\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), \(BH\) is the midpoint of \(AC\), and \(CH\) is the midpoint of \(AB\).

Since \(HQ\) is the inradius of \(\triangle DEF\), it follows that \(HQ = \frac{1}{2}DE \cdot FG\), where \(FG\) is the height of \(\triangle DEF\) from side \(EF\). Similarly, \(HR = \frac{1}{2}DR \cdot FG\).

Using the fact that \(AH\) is the midpoint of \(BC\), we have \(AH = \frac{1}{2}BC\), and thus \(DH = BC - CH = BC - \frac{1}{2}AB\). Since \(D\) is on the extension of \(AC\) beyond \(C\), we have \(DC = CA + CE\). Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have \(CE^2 = AC^2 - AE^2 = AC^2 - \left(\frac{1}{2}BC \cdot AF\right)^2\).

Now, we apply the Law of Cosines to \(\triangle ADE\) and \(\triangle CEF\):

\(\cos \angle ADE = \frac{AD^2 + DE^2 - AE^2}{2 \cdot AD \cdot DE}\),
\(\cos \angle CEF = \frac{CE^2 + CF^2 - EF^2}{2 \cdot CE \cdot CF}\).

Since \(AP \perp EF\), we have \(AP = \frac{AF}{2}\), and since \(HQ \perp EF\), we have \(HQ = \frac{EF}{2}\). Using these facts, we can write \(DE = 2 \cdot HQ\) and \(CE = 2 \cdot \frac{HR}{2} = HR\). Substituting these values into the expressions for \(\cos \angle ADE\) and \(\cos \angle CEF\), we obtain:

\(\cos \angle ADE = \frac{AD^2 + 4HQ^2 - AE^2}{4AHQ}\),
\(\cos \angle CEF = \frac{HR^2 + CF^2 - EF^2}{HR \cdot CF}\).

Since \(D\), \(R\), and \(P\) are collinear, we have \(DR = AP = AF/2\). Using the Law of Cosines in \(\triangle ADF\), we have:

\(\cos \angle ADF = \frac{AD^2 + AF^2 - DF^2}{2 \cdot AD \cdot AF}\).

Since \(AP \perp EF\) and \(AF = 2 \cdot AP\), we have \(AF^2 = 4 \cdot AP^2 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{AF}{2}\right)^2 = 4 \cdot \left(\frac{DF}{2}\right)^2 = DF^2\). Therefore, \(\cos \angle ADF = \frac{AD^2 + DF^2 - DF^2}{2 \cdot AD \cdot DF} = \frac{AD^2}{2 \cdot AD \cdot DF} = \frac{1}{2DF/AD}\).

Since \(HQ \perp EF\) and \(HQ = \frac{EF}{2}\), we have \(\cos \angle CEF = \cos \angle ACF = \frac{CF}{2 \cdot HQ} = \frac{CF}{EF}\).

Since \(\angle ADE\), \(\angle ADF\), and \(\angle CEF\) are angles of a single triangle \(\triangle ADE\), we have \(\angle ADE + \angle ADF + \angle CEF = 180^\circ\). Using the fact that the sum of the cosines of the angles of a triangle is equal to 1, we have:

\(\cos \angle ADE + \cos \angle ADF + \cos \angle CEF = 1\),
\(\frac{AD^2 + 4HQ^2 - AE^2}{4AHQ} + \frac{1}{2DF/AD} + \frac{CF}{EF} = 1\).

Solving for \(HQ/HR\) by cross-multiplying and simplifying, we obtain:

\(\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{2 \cdot AD \cdot CF + 4 \cdot HQ \cdot DF}{2 \cdot AD \cdot DF + 4 \cdot HQ \cdot CF}\).

Since \(AD = BC/2\), \(AF = BC \cdot \sin A/2\), \(CF = AB \cdot \sin C/2\), and \(DF = AC \cdot \sin B/2\), we have:

\(\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{BC \cdot \sin A/2 \cdot AB \cdot \sin C/2 + 2 \cdot BC \cdot HQ \cdot AC \cdot \sin B/2}{2 \cdot BC \cdot AC \cdot \sin B/2 \cdot AB \cdot \sin C/2 + 2 \cdot BC \cdot HQ \cdot AB \cdot \sin A/2 \cdot \sin C/2}\).

Since \(\sin A/2 = \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c}\), \(\sin B/2 = \sqrt{s(s-b)(s-c)/a}\), and \(\sin C/2 = \sqrt{s(s-c)(s-a)/b}\), where \(s = (a+b+c)/2\) is the semiperimeter of \(\triangle ABC\), we have:

\(\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{BC \cdot AB \cdot \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c} \cdot \sqrt{s(s-b)(s-c)/a} + 2 \cdot BC^2 \cdot HQ \cdot AC \cdot \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c}}{2 \cdot BC \cdot AC \cdot \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c} \cdot \sqrt{s(s-b)(s-c)/a} + 2 \cdot BC \cdot HQ^2 \cdot \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c} \cdot \sqrt{s(s-c)(s-a)/b}}\).

Simplifying the expression using the fact that \(s = BC + CA + AB = 2(BC + CA)/2 + AB = 2s'/2 + AB = s' + AB/2\), where \(s' = (BC+CA)/2\), we obtain:

\(\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{2 \cdot BC \cdot AB \cdot \sqrt{s'(s'-a)(s'-b)/c} \cdot \sqrt{s'(s'-b)(s'-c)/a} + AB^2 \cdot HQ \cdot \sqrt{s'(s'-a)(s'-b)/c}}{2 \cdot BC \cdot AC \cdot \sqrt{s'(s'-a)(s'-b)/c} \cdot \sqrt{s'(s'-b)(s'-c)/a} + 2 \cdot AB^2 \cdot HQ^2 \cdot \sqrt{s'(s'-a)(s'-c)/b}}\).

Since \(s' = BC/2\) and \(AC = AB \cdot \tan C/2\), we have:

\(\frac{HQ}{HR} = \frac{2 \cdot BC \cdot AB \cdot \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c} \cdot \sqrt{s(s-b)(s-c)/a} + AB^2 \cdot HQ \cdot \sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c}}{2 \cdot BC \cdot AB

Problem:
A tournament is a directed graph for which every (unordered) pair of vertices has a single directed edge from one vertex to the other.  Let us define a proper directed-edge-coloring to be an assignment of a color to every (directed) edge, so that for every pair of directed edges $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{vw}$, those two edges are in different colors.  Note that it is permissible for $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{uw}$ to be the same color.  The directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament is defined to be the minimum total number of colors that can be used in order to create a proper directed-edge-coloring.  For each $n$, determine the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number over all tournaments on $n$ vertices.

  [1] Let $T$ be a tournament on $n$ vertices. We will show that the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of $T$ is equal to $n$. This will be done by constructing a proper directed-edge-coloring using $n$ colors.

Let $C_i$ denote the set of edges with color $i$, for $i = 1, 2, \dots, n$. We define the coloring recursively as follows. For each vertex $v$, let $N^+(v)$ denote the set of vertices that have a directed edge to $v$. We color the edges in $N^+(v)$ with distinct colors in increasing order: $C_{i(v)}$, $C_{i(v)+1}$, ..., $C_{n}$. Here, $i(v)$ is the smallest index such that $i(v) \ge 1$ and $C_{i(v)}$ is empty.

Now, we need to show that this coloring is proper. Consider any two edges $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{vw}$. Since $T$ is a tournament, there is no edge between $u$ and $w$. If $u$ and $w$ are distinct, then $u$ has a directed edge to $v$, and $v$ has a directed edge to $w$. By the definition of our coloring, the edges $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{vw}$ have distinct colors, as they belong to different sets $C_{i(u)}$ and $C_{i(v)}$, respectively.

Finally, we need to show that we use exactly $n$ colors. We have already used $n-1$ colors for the edges leaving each vertex. The last color is used for the self-loop at each vertex, which exists in a tournament. Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n$ vertices is $n$.
  [2] Given a tournament on $n$ vertices, we can obtain a proper directed-edge-coloring by applying the following recursive procedure:

1. Color the edges incident to a fixed vertex $v$ with distinct colors.
2. For each uncolored neighbor $u$ of $v$, color the edges $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{vu}$ with distinct colors.
3. Repeat step 2 for all uncolored neighbors of $u$.

This procedure guarantees a proper directed-edge-coloring since for any pair of directed edges $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{vw}$, they are colored differently if and only if they are incident to distinct vertices $u$ and $w$, or if they have opposite directions.

Now, let's analyze the number of colors required for this coloring. The coloring of the edges incident to a fixed vertex requires at least as many colors as the number of its neighbors. Since a tournament has no self-loops, each vertex has at least one neighbor. Therefore, the minimum number of colors for a proper directed-edge-coloring of a single vertex is 2.

For the remaining edges, we can bound the number of colors required by the maximum degree of the tournament. Since every vertex has at least one neighbor, the maximum degree is $n-1$.

Thus, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n$ vertices is $2 + (n-1) = n$.
  [3] Let $n$ be the number of vertices in the tournament. We can use Hall's marriage theorem to bound the directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament. Hall's theorem states that in a bipartite graph with parts $A$ and $B$, and where every subset $S \subseteq A$ satisfies the condition that there exists a subset $T \subseteq B$ such that every vertex in $S$ is adjacent to every vertex in $T$, then the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges is equal to the size of the smallest such subset $S$.

We construct a bipartite graph as follows: the parts are the vertices and the directions of the edges in the tournament. For each vertex $v$, we add two copies, $v^-$ and $v^+$, in the respective parts. For each directed edge $\overrightarrow{uv}$, we add an edge between $u^-$ and $v^+$.

Now, consider any subset $S \subseteq V$ of vertices. We need to show that there exists a subset $T \subseteq V$ such that every vertex in $S$ is adjacent to every vertex in $T$. Let $S^+ = \{v^+ \mid v \in S\}$ and $S^- = \{v^- \mid v \in S\}$. Since every vertex in $S$ has a unique outgoing edge, every vertex in $S$ is adjacent to every vertex in $V \setminus S$. Thus, for every $v \in S$, there exists a vertex $w \in V \setminus S$ such that $\overrightarrow{wv}$ is an edge in the tournament. It follows that $w^+$ is adjacent to every vertex in $S^+$. Therefore, we can take $T = \{w^+ \mid \exists v \in S: \overrightarrow{wv} \in E\}$.

By Hall's marriage theorem, the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges in the tournament is equal to the size of the smallest such subset $S$. This completes the proof.
  [4] Let $T$ be a tournament on $n$ vertices. We will show that the directed-edge-chromatic-number of $T$ is at most $n$. This will be achieved by induction on $n$.

Base case: For $n=1$, there is only one vertex and no edges, so the minimum number of colors needed is 0.

Inductive step: Assume that the statement holds for tournaments on $n-1$ vertices. We will show that it also holds for a tournament $T$ on $n$ vertices.

Let $T'$ be the tournament obtained from $T$ by removing one vertex $v$ and the incident edges. By the induction hypothesis, $T'$ can be properly colored with at most $n-1$ colors. Now, let $C$ be the set of colors used in the coloring of $T'$. We will extend this coloring to $T$ as follows:

1. Color all edges incident to $v$ with a new color $c_v$ not in $C$.
2. For every edge $\overrightarrow{uv}$ in $T$ with $u\neq v$, keep the same color as in $T'$.

This coloring is proper since for any edge $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{vw}$, they belong to $T'$ and have different colors by the induction hypothesis, or they are incident to $v$ and have different colors by construction.

Therefore, the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the edges of $T$ is at most $n$, completing the induction proof.
  [5] By the Brooks' theorem for graph chromatic number, the maximum degree of a vertex in a tournament on $n$ vertices determines the directed-edge-chromatic-number: if $d$ is the maximum degree, then the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number is $d+1$. Since every vertex in a tournament has degree $n-1$, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on $n$ vertices is $n$.

Moreover, this can be achieved by a proper directed-edge-coloring using the parity technique. Assign color $1$ to all edges with an odd number of incoming edges and color $2$ to all edges with an even number of incoming edges. This coloring is proper, as for any two directed edges $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{vw}$, the incoming edges to $v$ have different parities, ensuring the colors are distinct.

Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on $n$ vertices is $n$.
  [6] A tournament on n vertices can be represented as a complete directed graph on n vertices with exactly n diagonal edges removed. The diagonal edges correspond to self-loops, which cannot exist in a tournament.

We will show that the minimum number of colors for a proper directed-edge-coloring is equal to the minimum number of colors for a proper vertex-coloring of the underlying undirected graph. This is because the colors of the edges incident to a vertex u determine the colors of the edges leaving u, and no two edges leaving u can have the same color.

A well-known result in graph theory states that the minimum number of colors for a proper vertex-coloring of a simple graph is the chromatic number, which is the smallest integer k such that the graph can be vertex-colored with k colors, and no two adjacent vertices share the same color.

The chromatic number of a simple graph can be bounded from above by the maximum degree, which in this case is n-1 for a tournament on n vertices. By the Brooks' theorem, the chromatic number of a simple graph with maximum degree d is at most d or d-1, depending on whether the graph contains an odd cycle or not. A tournament does not contain an odd cycle, so its chromatic number is at most n-1.

Taking the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of n-1, we obtain the bound of ⌈log2(n-1)⌉ for the minimum number of colors for a proper directed-edge-coloring of a tournament on n vertices.

Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number over all tournaments on n vertices is ⌈log2(n-1)⌉.
  [7] Assign a color to each edge based on the carry bits when adding the binary representations of the source and target vertices. More specifically, let \(u\) and \(v\) be the source and target vertices of edge \(\overrightarrow{uv}\), and let \(u_i\) and \(v_i\) denote the \(i\)-th digits of their binary representations. If \(u_i \neq v_i\), then color \(\overrightarrow{uv}\) with color \(i+1\). If \(u_i = v_i\), then color \(\overrightarrow{uv}\) with the color of the previous edge with a different \(i\)-th digit, or color \(1\) if no such edge exists.

This coloring is proper since, for any pair of directed edges \(\overrightarrow{uv}\) and \(\overrightarrow{vw}\), their source vertices \(u\) and \(v\) differ in at least one binary digit, implying that their corresponding colors are distinct.

The number of colors used in this construction is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of \(n\) (i.e., \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil \)). Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on \(n\) vertices is indeed \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\).
  [8] Given a tournament on n vertices, we can construct a proper directed-edge-coloring using binary labels as follows. Label the vertices as {1, 2, 3, ..., n}. For any two vertices u and v, let k be the smallest index such that the binary representations of u and v differ in the k-th bit. We then assign color 2^i to the edge from u to v and color 2^j to the edge from v to u, where i = floor(k/2) and j = k XOR i. This ensures that no two edges receive the same color.

Now, let's analyze the number of colors required for this construction. Since each bit in the binary representation contributes to the coloring of at most two edges, the total number of colors used is equal to the sum of the number of set bits in the binary representation of n. This can be calculated using the binary representation of n. Since the number of set bits in the binary representation of n is equal to the number of 1's in the binary representation of n + 1 (since the most significant bit of n is always 1), we have:

Number of colors = 1 + ∑2i=0log2n-1 1 = 1 + log2(2^(log2n) - 1) = 1 + log2(n - 1) = log2(n)

Since we round up to the nearest integer to get the directed-edge-chromatic-number, the minimum number of colors required is ⌈log2n⌉.

Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number over all tournaments on n vertices is ⌈log2n⌉.
  [9] To prove the correctness of the construction, we need to show that no two edges receive the same color. Let \(u, v, w\) be three distinct vertices, and let \(k\) be the first position where their binary representations differ. Without loss of generality, assume the \(k\)-th digit of \(u\) is \(0\) and the \(k\)-th digit of \(v\) is \(1\). Then, the \(k\)-th digit of \(w\) must be one of \(0\) or \(1\).

If the \(k\)-th digit of \(w\) is \(0\), then the edges \(u \to v\) and \(v \to w\) have different colors since their binary representations differ in the \(k\)-th position.

If the \(k\)-th digit of \(w\) is \(1\), then the edges \(u \to v\) and \(w \to v\) have different colors since their binary representations differ in the \(k\)-th position.

Therefore, the construction provides a proper directed-edge-coloring using \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\) colors.

This is because each vertex has \(\log_2 n\) binary digits, and each digit contributes one potential color difference. Since we need at least one color difference for each pair of edges, the minimum number of colors required is the number of binary digits, or \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\).

In conclusion, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on \(n\) vertices is \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\).
  [10] For the base case \(n=2\), there is only one edge between two vertices, so a single color is sufficient.

Now assume the result holds for tournaments on \(n-1\) vertices. Consider a tournament on \(n\) vertices. By the assumption, we can properly color the edges between the first \(n-1\) vertices with \(\lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil\) colors. For the last vertex \(v\), we can color its edges to the first \(n-1\) vertices using the \((2^{\lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil} - 1)\)-th color and the \((\lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil + 1)\)-th color. This is possible because there are \(2^{\lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil}\) colors in total, and at least one of these colors has not been used for the edges between the first \(n-1\) vertices.

Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on \(n\) vertices is \(\lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil + 1 = \lceil \log_2 n \rceil\).
  [11] Let \(T\) be a tournament on \(n\) vertices, where \(n\) is even. We will construct a proper directed-edge-coloring using the binary representation of the vertex labels, as described in the partial solution.

By induction hypothesis, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on \(n-2\) vertices is \(\lceil \log_2 (n-2) \rceil\).

First, we color the edges between vertices \(1\) and \(n-2\) using the colors from the induction hypothesis. Since there are \(\binom{n-1}{2}\) edges between these vertices, we use \(\lceil \log_2 \binom{n-1}{2} \rceil\) colors. By the binomial coefficient identity \(\binom{n}{2} = \binom{n}{1} + \binom{n-1}{2}\), we have \(\binom{n-1}{2} = \frac{n(n-1)}{2} - \frac{(n-1)}{2} = \frac{n(n-3)}{2}\). Therefore, \(\lceil \log_2 \binom{n-1}{2} \rceil = \lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \rceil = \lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \rceil + \lceil \log_2 2 \rceil = \lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \rceil + 1\).

Now, we color the edges between vertices \(n-1\) and \(n\). Since there are \(n-1\) vertices in the subtournament between \(n-1\) and \(n\), we use \(\lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil\) colors.

In total, we use \(\lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \rceil + \lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil + 1\) colors to color all edges in the tournament \(T\).

We claim that this is a proper directed-edge-coloring. Let \(\overrightarrow{uv}\) and \(\overrightarrow{vw}\) be any two distinct edges. If \(u, v, w\) are all distinct, then the colors of these edges come from different sets: the colors of edges between \(1\) and \(n-2\), the color of the edge \(n-1 \to n\), and the color of the edge \(n \to w\). If \(u = v\), then the colors of \(\overrightarrow{uv}\) and \(\overrightarrow{vw}\) are determined by their endpoints, and they are different since \(w \neq u\).

Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on \(n\) vertices is \(\lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \rceil + \lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil + 1 = \lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-3)}{2} \rceil + \lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil + 1 = \lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-3)}{2} + \log_2 (n-1) + 1 \rceil = \lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-3)(n-1)}{2} \rceil = \lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{4} \rceil = \lceil \log_2 \frac{n(n-1)(n-2)}{2^3} \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 \frac{n-2}{2} \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) - \log_2 2 \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) + 1 \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) + 1 - \log_2 2 \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) + 1 - 1 \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1) + \log_2 (n-2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n + \log_2 (n-1)
  [12] By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a vertex in $S$ with at least $\lceil \frac{n}{2} \rceil$ incoming red edges. Let $v$ be such a vertex. We color all edges out of $v$ with a new color, say blue. By the construction, no edge out of $v$ can have the same color as an edge into $v$, since the first position where their binary representations differ is always to the left of the position of the common bit in their labels.

Now, consider the subtournament induced by the vertices in $S \setminus \{v\}$. By the induction hypothesis, this subtournament can be properly edge-colored using $\lceil \log_2 (|S \setminus \{v\}|) \rceil$ colors. Adding the colors for the edges out of $v$ and the color for the edges between $v$ and the other vertices, we obtain a proper edge-coloring of the entire tournament using $\lceil \log_2 |S| \rceil = \lceil \log_2 (n-1) + 1 \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n \rceil$ colors.

Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n$ vertices is indeed $\lceil \log_2 n \rceil$.
  [13] By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a vertex in \(V \setminus S\) with at least two incoming red edges, say from vertices \(u\) and \(v\). Since \(u, v \in S\), we have \(u \neq v\). By the definition of our coloring, \(\overrightarrow{uv}\) and \(\overrightarrow{vw}\) for some \(w \in V \setminus S\) must have different colors. Now, let \(C_1\) be the color of \(\overrightarrow{uv}\) and \(C_2\) be the color of \(\overrightarrow{vw}\). We recolor all edges from \(v\) to vertices in \(S\) with color \(C_1\) to color \(C_2\), and all edges from \(v\) to vertices in \(V \setminus S\) with color \(C_2\) to color \(C_1\). This results in a proper directed-edge-coloring of the tournament with one fewer vertex, \(n-1\). By the induction hypothesis, this tournament has directed-edge-chromatic-number \(\lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil\). Since we used at most two colors for the vertices in \(S\), the total number of colors used in the original tournament is \(\lceil \log_2 (n-1) \rceil + 2\). Since \(\log_2 n\) is an increasing function, this is less than or equal to \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\). Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on \(n\) vertices is indeed \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\).
  [14] By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a vertex in \(S\) with at least \(n/4\) incoming red edges, since \(|S| \geq n/2\) and each vertex in \(S\) has at least one incoming red edge. Now, we color all the edges from this vertex to other vertices in \(S\) with a new color, say blue. This does not violate the proper coloring condition, as any pair of edges \(\overrightarrow{uv}\) and \(\overrightarrow{vw}\) with \(u, v, w \in S\) have different colors (red and blue) if \(k\)-th digits in their binary representations are different.

Now, we recursively color the subtournament induced by the vertices in \(V \setminus S\) with the remaining colors. By the induction hypothesis, this subtournament can be properly colored with \(\lceil \log_2 (n-|S|) \rceil\) colors. Since \(|S| \leq n/2\), we have \(\lceil \log_2 (n-|S|) \rceil \leq \lceil \log_2 (n/2) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n \rceil - 1\).

Thus, the entire tournament can be properly colored with \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\) colors: the red color for the edges from the vertex with at least \(n/4\) incoming red edges, and the remaining colors for the edges in the subtournament induced by the vertices in \(V \setminus S\). Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on \(n\) vertices is indeed \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\).
  [15] To prove that there is no red edge contained in \(S\), assume for contradiction that there exists a red edge \(e = u \to v\) with both \(u, v \in S\). Let \(T\) be the subtournament induced by \(S\). Since \(T\) is a subgraph of the original tournament, it also has a proper directed-edge-coloring using at most \(\lceil \log_2 |S| \rceil\) colors. However, since \(e\) is red, both \(u \to v\) and \(v \to u\) must have different colors in this coloring. But this contradicts the fact that \(|S|\) is even and at least \(n/2\), so there are not enough colors for both edges. Therefore, no such red edge \(e = u \to v\) with \(u, v \in S\) exists.

Now, consider the vertices in \(V \setminus S\). By the pigeonhole principle, there must exist two vertices \(x, y \in V \setminus S\) such that the first position \(k\) where their binary representations differ is in the \((|S|+1)\)-th position (since \(|S|\) is even, this position is in the binary representation of at least one vertex in \(V \setminus S\)). Let \(u\) be the vertex in \(S\) whose binary representation differs from \(x\) in the \(k\)-th position, and let \(v\) be the vertex in \(S\) whose binary representation differs from \(y\) in the \(k\)-th position. Since \(u \to v\) is an edge in our coloring, and \(x \notin S\), we can assign a new color to \(x \to y\) without violating the condition of proper coloring. This completes the coloring of the entire tournament.

By the above construction, we have shown that the minimum number of colors needed to properly edge-color a tournament on \(n\) vertices is indeed \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\).
  [16] Given a proper directed-edge-coloring of the subgraph induced by \(S\), we extend it to the entire graph as follows. For each vertex \(v \in V \setminus S\), let \(w\) be the unique vertex in \(S\) such that there exists a red edge \(w \to v\). Since \(w \in S\) has no red edges going out of it, the edge \(v \to w\) must be colored differently, say blue. We color all edges \(v \to u\) for \(u \in S\) with colors distinct from those in the coloring of \(S\). This results in a proper directed-edge-coloring of the entire graph using \(\lceil \log_2 |S| \rceil + 1 \leq \lceil \log_2 (n/2) \rceil + 1 \leq \lceil \log_2 n \rceil\) colors.

Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on \(n\) vertices is indeed \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\).
  [17] By the pigeonhole principle, there exists a vertex in \(S\) with at least \(n/4\) neighbors in \(V \setminus S\). Let \(u\) be such a vertex. Since \(u\) has no red edges, we can assign a new color, say blue, to all the edges from \(u\) to its neighbors in \(V \setminus S\). This uses \(n/4\) new colors.

Now consider the subgraph induced by \(S\) and the vertices in \(V \setminus S\) that are not neighbors of \(u\). By the induction hypothesis, this subgraph has a proper directed-edge-coloring using at most \(\lceil \log_2 (|S|) \rceil\) colors.

Adding the colors for the edges from \(u\) to its neighbors in \(V \setminus S\) and the colors for the edges in the subgraph, we obtain a proper directed-edge-coloring for the entire tournament using at most \(\lceil \log_2 |S| \rceil + 1 + \lceil \log_2 (|V \setminus S|) \rceil = \lceil \log_2 n \rceil\) colors.

Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on \(n\) vertices is \(\lceil \log_2 n \rceil\).
  [18] Since \(S\) has no red edges and \(n/2\) vertices, we can properly color the edges within \(S\) using \(\log_2(n/2)\) colors by our induction hypothesis. For the edges between \(S\) and \(V\setminus S\), we can use an additional color to ensure a proper coloring. Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for the tournament on \(n\) vertices is \(\log_2(n)+1\).

To color the edges between \(S\) and \(V\setminus S\), note that each vertex in \(S\) has exactly one outgoing edge to \(V\setminus S\). We can assign a unique color to each of these edges. This does not conflict with the coloring within \(S\) because no two vertices in \(S\) have the same binary representation up to the first position where they differ. Thus, we have a proper directed-edge-coloring of the entire tournament using \(\log_2(n)+1\) colors.

In conclusion, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on \(n\) vertices is \(\log_2(n)+1\).
  [19] To complete the proof by induction, we need to show that the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on $n$ vertices is indeed $\log_2 n$. Let $T$ be a tournament on $n$ vertices with minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number $\chi$.

By the construction in the partial solution, we know that $\chi \geq \log_2 n$. Now, we will show that $\chi \leq \log_2 n$ by constructing a proper directed-edge-coloring for $T$ using $\log_2 n$ colors.

Let $V = \{v_1, v_2, \dots, v_n\}$ be the set of vertices in $T$. We will label each vertex with a binary number as in the construction in the partial solution. Let $c(v_i)$ denote the color assigned to the edge $v_i \to v_j$ for some $j$. We will define a recursive coloring scheme as follows:

1. Set $c(v_1) = 0$.
2. For $i = 2, 3, \dots, n$:
   a. Find the smallest index $j < i$ such that $c(v_j)$ and $c(v_{j'})$ differ in the $k$-th bit, where $k$ is the position of the first bit difference between $i$ and $j$ in binary representation.
   b. Set $c(v_i) = c(v_j) \oplus 1$, where $\oplus$ denotes the bitwise XOR operation.

This coloring scheme ensures that for any two edges $\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\overrightarrow{vw}$, their colors differ in at least one bit. Therefore, $\chi \leq \log_2 n$ since there are $\log_2 n$ binary digits.

Thus, we have shown by induction that the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on $n$ vertices is indeed $\log_2 n$.
  [20] The proof by induction is complete. Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n$ vertices is $\lceil\log_2 n\rceil$. This result follows from the construction provided and the inductive argument.

In the base case, when $n = 1$, a single vertex has no edges, so the minimum number of colors required is 1. For $n > 1$, the induction hypothesis assumes that the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n-1$ vertices is $\lceil\log_2 (n-1)\rceil$. By the construction, we can add a new vertex $v$ and color its edges with the colors used for the vertices in the tournament on $n-1$ vertices, ensuring that no two edges have the same color. Since $\lceil\log_2 (n-1)\rceil + 1 = \lceil\log_2 n\rceil$, the result holds for $n$ as well.

In conclusion, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n$ vertices is $\lceil\log_2 n\rceil$.
