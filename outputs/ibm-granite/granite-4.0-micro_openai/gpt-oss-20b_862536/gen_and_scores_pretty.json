    "Consider the sequence of usamons labeled \\(1, 2, \\ldots, 2015\\). For each usamon \\(i\\), define a directed edge from \\(i\\) to \\(i+1\\) (with \\(2016\\) considered as \\(1\\)).

If \\( f(f(a)) \\) is already present, delete \\( f(a) \\), so the size of \\( D \\) doesn't change and the set of bad edges becomes a strict subset of what it was before, so the sum of their weights goes down. Now suppose \\( f(f(a)) \\) is not already present. If there are elements that map to \\( f(f(a)) \\) in the tree rooted at \\( f(f(a)) \\) that are in \\( D \\), then we can simply delete \\( f(a) \\), and by the same logic as before, we're fine. So now suppose that there are no elements in the tree rooted at \\( f(f(a)) \\) that map to it. Then, deleting \\( f(a) \\) and adding \\( f(f(a)) \\) removes an edge of weight \\( \\omega \\) and only adds edges of weight \\( 1 \\), so the size of \\( D \\) stays the same and the sum of the weights goes down. This shows that we can reduce \\( D \\) down such that the only bad edges of \\( D \\) are on the central cycle. Call a vertex of the central cycle *deficient* if it does not have any elements of \\( D \\) one level above it in the tree rooted at the vertex, or in other words, a vertex is deficient if it will not be covered by \\( D \\cup f(D) \\) if we remove all the cycle elements from \\( D \\). Note that all elements of \\( D \\) on the cycle are deficient since there are no bad edges not on the cycle. Fixing \\( D \\) and changing which subset of deficient vertices we choose, the claim reduces to the following: Suppose we have a directed cycle of length \\( m \\), and some \\( k \\) of the vertices are said to be deficient. There is a subset \\( D \\) of the deficient vertices such that all the deficient vertices are covered by either \\( D \\) or the image of \\( D \\) of minimal size such that at most one edge of the cycle has both endpoints in \\( D \\). To prove this, split the deficient vertices into contiguous blocks. First suppose that the entire cycle is not a block. Each block acts independently, and is isomorphic to a directed path. It is clear that in this case, it is optimal to pick every other vertex from each block, and any other selection covering every vertex of the block with it and its image will be of larger size. Thus, it suffices to look at the case where all vertices are deficient. In this case, it is again clearly optimal to select \\( (m+1)/2 \\) of the vertices such that there is only one bad edge, so we're done.\n\nThe minimum \\( k \\) is \\( 51 \\).",
    "Consider the arrow graph of \\( f \\) on \\( X \\). Each connected component looks like a directed cycle with a bunch of trees coming off each vertex of the cycle. For each connected component \\( C \\), let \\( \\alpha(C) \\) be the maximum number of elements of \\( C \\) we can choose such that their image under \\( f \\) is disjoint from them, and let \\( \\beta(C) \\) be the minimum number of vertices of \\( C \\) we can choose such that they and their image cover \\( C \\). We have the following key claim:\n\n**Claim:** We have \\( \\alpha(C) \\geq \\beta(C) - 1 \\).\n\n**Proof:** It suffices to show that given a subset \\( D \\subseteq C \\) such that \\( D \\) and \\( f(D) \\) cover \\( C \\), we can find a subset \\( D' \\subseteq C \\) such that \\( |D'| \\leq |D| \\) and such that there is at most one pair of elements from \\( D' \\) that are adjacent. Label the edges of \\( C \\) with ordinal numbers. Label the edges of the cycle with \\( 1 \\), and for any edge with depth \\( k \\) into the tree it's in (with depth \\( 1 \\) for edges incident to the cycle), label it with \\( \\omega^k \\).\n\nSuppose we're given \\( D \\subseteq C \\) such that \\( D \\) and \\( f(D) \\) cover \\( C \\). Call an edge *bad* if both of its endpoints are in \\( D \\). We'll show that either all the bad edges are on the central cycle, or there is a way to modify \\( D \\) such that its cardinality does not increase and the sum of the weights of the bad edges decreases. Since we can't have infinite decreasing sequences of ordinals, we'll reduce the problem to the case where the only bad edges are on the central cycle.\n\nSuppose we have a bad edge \\( a \\to f(a) \\) with weight \\( \\omega^k \\) for \\( k \\geq 2 \\). Modify \\( D \\) by removing \\( f(a) \\) from \\( D \\) and adding \\( f(f(a)) \\) if it is not already present. If \\( f(f(a)) \\) is already present, then the size of \\( D \\) decreases and the set of bad edges becomes a strict subset of what it was before, so the sum of their weights goes down. If \\( f(f(a)) \\) is not already present, then the size of \\( D \\) doesn't change, and we lose at least one bad edge with weight \\( \\omega^k \\), potentially gaining many bad edges with weights \\( \\omega^{k-1} \\) or \\( \\omega^{k-2} \\), so the total weight sum goes down.\n\nSuppose we have a bad edge \\( a \\to f(a) \\) with weight \\( \\omega \\). Then, \\( f(a) \\) is part of the central cycle of \\( C \\). If \\( f(f(a)) \\) is already present, delete \\( f(a) \\), so the size of \\( D \\) doesn't change and the set of bad edges becomes a strict subset of what it was before, so the sum of their weights goes down. Now suppose \\( f(f(a)) \\) is not already present. If there are elements that map to \\( f(f(a)) \\) in the tree rooted at \\( f(f(a)) \\) that are in \\( D \\), then we can simply delete \\( f(a) \\), and by the same logic as before, we're fine. So now suppose that there are no elements in the tree rooted at \\( f(f(a)) \\) that map to it. Then, deleting \\( f(a) \\) and adding \\( f(f(a)) \\) removes an edge of weight \\( \\omega \\) and only adds edges of weight \\( 1 \\), so the size of \\( D \\) stays the same and the sum of the weights goes down. This shows that we can reduce \\( D \\) down such that the only bad edges of \\( D \\) are on the central cycle.\n\nCall a vertex of the central cycle *deficient* if it does not have any elements of \\( D \\) one level above it in the tree rooted at the vertex, or in other words, a vertex is deficient if it will not be covered by \\( D \\cup f(D) \\) if we remove all the cycle elements from \\( D \\). Note that all elements of \\( D \\) on the cycle are deficient since there are no bad edges not on the cycle. Fixing \\( D \\) and changing which subset of deficient vertices we choose, the claim reduces to the following: Suppose we have a directed cycle of length \\( m \\), and some \\( k \\) of the vertices are said to be deficient.

Thus, it suffices to look at the case where all vertices are deficient. In this case, it is again clearly optimal to select \\( (m+1)/2 \\) of the vertices such that there is only one bad edge, so we're done.\n\nThis completes the proof of the claim.
