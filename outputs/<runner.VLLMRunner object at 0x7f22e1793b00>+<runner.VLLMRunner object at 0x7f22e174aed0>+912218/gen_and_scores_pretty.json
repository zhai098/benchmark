    "In an acute scalene triangle $ABC$, points $D, E, F$ are on sides $BC, CA, AB$, respectively, such that $AD \\perp BC$, $BE \\perp CA$, $CF \\perp AB$.

By the Angle Bisector Theorem, $AH$ is the angle bisector of angle $DEF$, so $AH \\perp BE$.\n\nSince $HQ$ is a radius of the inscribed circle of $\\triangle DEF$, $HQ = OE = \\frac{1}{2}EF$.

Since $AH$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABC$ and $AH = ME$, $AH$ is also an altitude of $\\triangle ABM$.\n\nSince $AH$ is an altitude of $\\triangle ABM$ and $R$ is the intersection point of $DP$ and $QH$, $R$ lies on $AH$. Since $AH$ is also a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\\triangle DEM$, $AH$ bisects angle $DEM$.\n\nSince $AH$ bisects angle $DEM$, angle $DRM = \\angle DEM$. Since $AP$ is a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\\triangle DEF$, angle $APF = \\angle DEF$. Since $AP$ is also a diameter of the circle inscribed in $\\triangle DEM$, angle $APM = \\angle DEM$.\n\nThus, $\\angle APF = \\angle APF + \\angle APM = \\angle APF + \\angle DRP + \\angle RPM = \\angle APF + \\angle DRP + \\angle RMQ + \\angle QMH + \\angle HQM = \\angle APF + \\angle DRP + \\angle RMQ + \\angle HQM + \\angle MHQ = \\angle APF + \\angle DRP + \\angle RMQ + \\frac{1}{2}(\\angle DEF + \\angle FDE) + \\angle HQM$.\n\nSince $\\angle APF = \\angle HQM = 90^\\circ$, it follows that $\\angle DEF + \\angle FDE = 180^\\circ$.

Using the Pythagorean theorem, we have \\(CE^2 = AC^2 - AE^2 = AC^2 - \\left(\\frac{1}{2}BC \\cdot AF\\right)^2\\).\n\nNow, we apply the Law of Cosines to \\(\\triangle ADE\\) and \\(\\triangle CEF\\):\n\n\\(\\cos \\angle ADE = \\frac{AD^2 + DE^2 - AE^2}{2 \\cdot AD \\cdot DE}\\),\n\\(\\cos \\angle CEF = \\frac{CE^2 + CF^2 - EF^2}{2 \\cdot CE \\cdot CF}\\).\n\nSince \\(AP \\perp EF\\), we have \\(AP = \\frac{AF}{2}\\), and since \\(HQ \\perp EF\\), we have \\(HQ = \\frac{EF}{2}\\).

Therefore, \\(\\cos \\angle ADF = \\frac{AD^2 + DF^2 - DF^2}{2 \\cdot AD \\cdot DF} = \\frac{AD^2}{2 \\cdot AD \\cdot DF} = \\frac{1}{2DF/AD}\\).\n\nSince \\(HQ \\perp EF\\) and \\(HQ = \\frac{EF}{2}\\), we have \\(\\cos \\angle CEF = \\cos \\angle ACF = \\frac{CF}{2 \\cdot HQ} = \\frac{CF}{EF}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\angle ADE\\), \\(\\angle ADF\\), and \\(\\angle CEF\\) are angles of a single triangle \\(\\triangle ADE\\), we have \\(\\angle ADE + \\angle ADF + \\angle CEF = 180^\\circ\\). Using the fact that the sum of the cosines of the angles of a triangle is equal to 1, we have:\n\n\\(\\cos \\angle ADE + \\cos \\angle ADF + \\cos \\angle CEF = 1\\),\n\\(\\frac{AD^2 + 4HQ^2 - AE^2}{4AHQ} + \\frac{1}{2DF/AD} + \\frac{CF}{EF} = 1\\).\n\nSolving for \\(HQ/HR\\) by cross-multiplying and simplifying, we obtain:\n\n\\(\\frac{HQ}{HR} = \\frac{2 \\cdot AD \\cdot CF + 4 \\cdot HQ \\cdot DF}{2 \\cdot AD \\cdot DF + 4 \\cdot HQ \\cdot CF}\\).\n\nSince \\(AD = BC/2\\), \\(AF = BC \\cdot \\sin A/2\\), \\(CF = AB \\cdot \\sin C/2\\), and \\(DF = AC \\cdot \\sin B/2\\), we have:\n\n\\(\\frac{HQ}{HR} = \\frac{BC \\cdot \\sin A/2 \\cdot AB \\cdot \\sin C/2 + 2 \\cdot BC \\cdot HQ \\cdot AC \\cdot \\sin B/2}{2 \\cdot BC \\cdot AC \\cdot \\sin B/2 \\cdot AB \\cdot \\sin C/2 + 2 \\cdot BC \\cdot HQ \\cdot AB \\cdot \\sin A/2 \\cdot \\sin C/2}\\).\n\nSince \\(\\sin A/2 = \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c}\\), \\(\\sin B/2 = \\sqrt{s(s-b)(s-c)/a}\\), and \\(\\sin C/2 = \\sqrt{s(s-c)(s-a)/b}\\), where \\(s = (a+b+c)/2\\) is the semiperimeter of \\(\\triangle ABC\\), we have:\n\n\\(\\frac{HQ}{HR} = \\frac{BC \\cdot AB \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c} \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-b)(s-c)/a} + 2 \\cdot BC^2 \\cdot HQ \\cdot AC \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c}}{2 \\cdot BC \\cdot AC \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c} \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-b)(s-c)/a} + 2 \\cdot BC \\cdot HQ^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c} \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-c)(s-a)/b}}\\).\n\nSimplifying the expression using the fact that \\(s = BC + CA + AB = 2(BC + CA)/2 + AB = 2s'/2 + AB = s' + AB/2\\), where \\(s' = (BC+CA)/2\\), we obtain:\n\n\\(\\frac{HQ}{HR} = \\frac{2 \\cdot BC \\cdot AB \\cdot \\sqrt{s'(s'-a)(s'-b)/c} \\cdot \\sqrt{s'(s'-b)(s'-c)/a} + AB^2 \\cdot HQ \\cdot \\sqrt{s'(s'-a)(s'-b)/c}}{2 \\cdot BC \\cdot AC \\cdot \\sqrt{s'(s'-a)(s'-b)/c} \\cdot \\sqrt{s'(s'-b)(s'-c)/a} + 2 \\cdot AB^2 \\cdot HQ^2 \\cdot \\sqrt{s'(s'-a)(s'-c)/b}}\\).\n\nSince \\(s' = BC/2\\) and \\(AC = AB \\cdot \\tan C/2\\), we have:\n\n\\(\\frac{HQ}{HR} = \\frac{2 \\cdot BC \\cdot AB \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c} \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-b)(s-c)/a} + AB^2 \\cdot HQ \\cdot \\sqrt{s(s-a)(s-b)/c}}{2 \\cdot BC \\cdot AB"

    "Let $T$ be a tournament on $n$ vertices. We will show that the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of $T$ is equal to $n$. This will be done by constructing a proper directed-edge-coloring using $n$ colors.\n\nLet $C_i$ denote the set of edges with color $i$, for $i = 1, 2, \\dots, n$. We define the coloring recursively as follows. For each vertex $v$, let $N^+(v)$ denote the set of vertices that have a directed edge to $v$. We color the edges in $N^+(v)$ with distinct colors in increasing order: $C_{i(v)}$, $C_{i(v)+1}$, ..., $C_{n}$. Here, $i(v)$ is the smallest index such that $i(v) \\ge 1$ and $C_{i(v)}$ is empty.\n\nNow, we need to show that this coloring is proper. Consider any two edges $\\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\\overrightarrow{vw}$. Since $T$ is a tournament, there is no edge between $u$ and $w$. If $u$ and $w$ are distinct, then $u$ has a directed edge to $v$, and $v$ has a directed edge to $w$. By the definition of our coloring, the edges $\\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\\overrightarrow{vw}$ have distinct colors, as they belong to different sets $C_{i(u)}$ and $C_{i(v)}$, respectively.\n\nFinally, we need to show that we use exactly $n$ colors. We have already used $n-1$ colors for the edges leaving each vertex. The last color is used for the self-loop at each vertex, which exists in a tournament. Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n$ vertices is $n$.",
    "Given a tournament on $n$ vertices, we can obtain a proper directed-edge-coloring by applying the following recursive procedure:\n\n1. Color the edges incident to a fixed vertex $v$ with distinct colors.\n2. For each uncolored neighbor $u$ of $v$, color the edges $\\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\\overrightarrow{vu}$ with distinct colors.\n3. Repeat step 2 for all uncolored neighbors of $u$.\n\nThis procedure guarantees a proper directed-edge-coloring since for any pair of directed edges $\\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\\overrightarrow{vw}$, they are colored differently if and only if they are incident to distinct vertices $u$ and $w$, or if they have opposite directions.\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of colors required for this coloring. The coloring of the edges incident to a fixed vertex requires at least as many colors as the number of its neighbors. Since a tournament has no self-loops, each vertex has at least one neighbor. Therefore, the minimum number of colors for a proper directed-edge-coloring of a single vertex is 2.\n\nFor the remaining edges, we can bound the number of colors required by the maximum degree of the tournament. Since every vertex has at least one neighbor, the maximum degree is $n-1$.\n\nThus, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n$ vertices is $2 + (n-1) = n$.",
    "Let $n$ be the number of vertices in the tournament. We can use Hall's marriage theorem to bound the directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament. Hall's theorem states that in a bipartite graph with parts $A$ and $B$, and where every subset $S \\subseteq A$ satisfies the condition that there exists a subset $T \\subseteq B$ such that every vertex in $S$ is adjacent to every vertex in $T$, then the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges is equal to the size of the smallest such subset $S$.\n\nWe construct a bipartite graph as follows: the parts are the vertices and the directions of the edges in the tournament. For each vertex $v$, we add two copies, $v^-$ and $v^+$, in the respective parts. For each directed edge $\\overrightarrow{uv}$, we add an edge between $u^-$ and $v^+$.\n\nNow, consider any subset $S \\subseteq V$ of vertices. We need to show that there exists a subset $T \\subseteq V$ such that every vertex in $S$ is adjacent to every vertex in $T$. Let $S^+ = \\{v^+ \\mid v \\in S\\}$ and $S^- = \\{v^- \\mid v \\in S\\}$. Since every vertex in $S$ has a unique outgoing edge, every vertex in $S$ is adjacent to every vertex in $V \\setminus S$. Thus, for every $v \\in S$, there exists a vertex $w \\in V \\setminus S$ such that $\\overrightarrow{wv}$ is an edge in the tournament. It follows that $w^+$ is adjacent to every vertex in $S^+$. Therefore, we can take $T = \\{w^+ \\mid \\exists v \\in S: \\overrightarrow{wv} \\in E\\}$.\n\nBy Hall's marriage theorem, the minimum number of colors needed to color the edges in the tournament is equal to the size of the smallest such subset $S$. This completes the proof.",
    "Let $T$ be a tournament on $n$ vertices. We will show that the directed-edge-chromatic-number of $T$ is at most $n$. This will be achieved by induction on $n$.\n\nBase case: For $n=1$, there is only one vertex and no edges, so the minimum number of colors needed is 0.\n\nInductive step: Assume that the statement holds for tournaments on $n-1$ vertices. We will show that it also holds for a tournament $T$ on $n$ vertices.\n\nLet $T'$ be the tournament obtained from $T$ by removing one vertex $v$ and the incident edges. By the induction hypothesis, $T'$ can be properly colored with at most $n-1$ colors. Now, let $C$ be the set of colors used in the coloring of $T'$. We will extend this coloring to $T$ as follows:\n\n1. Color all edges incident to $v$ with a new color $c_v$ not in $C$.\n2. For every edge $\\overrightarrow{uv}$ in $T$ with $u\\neq v$, keep the same color as in $T'$.\n\nThis coloring is proper since for any edge $\\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\\overrightarrow{vw}$, they belong to $T'$ and have different colors by the induction hypothesis, or they are incident to $v$ and have different colors by construction.\n\nTherefore, the minimum number of colors needed to properly color the edges of $T$ is at most $n$, completing the induction proof.",
    "By the Brooks' theorem for graph chromatic number, the maximum degree of a vertex in a tournament on $n$ vertices determines the directed-edge-chromatic-number: if $d$ is the maximum degree, then the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number is $d+1$. Since every vertex in a tournament has degree $n-1$, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on $n$ vertices is $n$.\n\nMoreover, this can be achieved by a proper directed-edge-coloring using the parity technique. Assign color $1$ to all edges with an odd number of incoming edges and color $2$ to all edges with an even number of incoming edges. This coloring is proper, as for any two directed edges $\\overrightarrow{uv}$ and $\\overrightarrow{vw}$, the incoming edges to $v$ have different parities, ensuring the colors are distinct.\n\nTherefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number for a tournament on $n$ vertices is $n$.",
    "A tournament on n vertices can be represented as a complete directed graph on n vertices with exactly n diagonal edges removed. The diagonal edges correspond to self-loops, which cannot exist in a tournament.\n\nWe will show that the minimum number of colors for a proper directed-edge-coloring is equal to the minimum number of colors for a proper vertex-coloring of the underlying undirected graph. This is because the colors of the edges incident to a vertex u determine the colors of the edges leaving u, and no two edges leaving u can have the same color.\n\nA well-known result in graph theory states that the minimum number of colors for a proper vertex-coloring of a simple graph is the chromatic number, which is the smallest integer k such that the graph can be vertex-colored with k colors, and no two adjacent vertices share the same color.\n\nThe chromatic number of a simple graph can be bounded from above by the maximum degree, which in this case is n-1 for a tournament on n vertices. By the Brooks' theorem, the chromatic number of a simple graph with maximum degree d is at most d or d-1, depending on whether the graph contains an odd cycle or not. A tournament does not contain an odd cycle, so its chromatic number is at most n-1.\n\nTaking the ceiling of the logarithm base 2 of n-1, we obtain the bound of ⌈log2(n-1)⌉ for the minimum number of colors for a proper directed-edge-coloring of a tournament on n vertices.\n\nTherefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number over all tournaments on n vertices is ⌈log2(n-1)⌉.",
    "Assign a color to each edge based on the carry bits when adding the binary representations of the source and target vertices.

If \\(u_i \\neq v_i\\), then color \\(\\overrightarrow{uv}\\) with color \\(i+1\\). If \\(u_i = v_i\\), then color \\(\\overrightarrow{uv}\\) with the color of the previous edge with a different \\(i\\)-th digit, or color \\(1\\) if no such edge exists.\n\nThis coloring is proper since, for any pair of directed edges \\(\\overrightarrow{uv}\\) and \\(\\overrightarrow{vw}\\), their source vertices \\(u\\) and \\(v\\) differ in at least one binary digit, implying that their corresponding colors are distinct.\n\nThe number of colors used in this construction is equal to the number of bits in the binary representation of \\(n\\) (i.e., \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil \\)). Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on \\(n\\) vertices is indeed \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).",
    "Given a tournament on n vertices, we can construct a proper directed-edge-coloring using binary labels as follows. Label the vertices as {1, 2, 3, ..., n}. For any two vertices u and v, let k be the smallest index such that the binary representations of u and v differ in the k-th bit. We then assign color 2^i to the edge from u to v and color 2^j to the edge from v to u, where i = floor(k/2) and j = k XOR i. This ensures that no two edges receive the same color.\n\nNow, let's analyze the number of colors required for this construction. Since each bit in the binary representation contributes to the coloring of at most two edges, the total number of colors used is equal to the sum of the number of set bits in the binary representation of n. This can be calculated using the binary representation of n. Since the number of set bits in the binary representation of n is equal to the number of 1's in the binary representation of n + 1 (since the most significant bit of n is always 1), we have:\n\nNumber of colors = 1 + ∑2i=0log2n-1 1 = 1 + log2(2^(log2n) - 1) = 1 + log2(n - 1) = log2(n)\n\nSince we round up to the nearest integer to get the directed-edge-chromatic-number, the minimum number of colors required is ⌈log2n⌉.\n\nTherefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number over all tournaments on n vertices is ⌈log2n⌉.",
    "To prove the correctness of the construction, we need to show that no two edges receive the same color.

Without loss of generality, assume the \\(k\\)-th digit of \\(u\\) is \\(0\\) and the \\(k\\)-th digit of \\(v\\) is \\(1\\). Then, the \\(k\\)-th digit of \\(w\\) must be one of \\(0\\) or \\(1\\).\n\nIf the \\(k\\)-th digit of \\(w\\) is \\(0\\), then the edges \\(u \\to v\\) and \\(v \\to w\\) have different colors since their binary representations differ in the \\(k\\)-th position.\n\nIf the \\(k\\)-th digit of \\(w\\) is \\(1\\), then the edges \\(u \\to v\\) and \\(w \\to v\\) have different colors since their binary representations differ in the \\(k\\)-th position.\n\nTherefore, the construction provides a proper directed-edge-coloring using \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\) colors.\n\nThis is because each vertex has \\(\\log_2 n\\) binary digits, and each digit contributes one potential color difference. Since we need at least one color difference for each pair of edges, the minimum number of colors required is the number of binary digits, or \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on \\(n\\) vertices is \\(\\lceil \\log_2 n \\rceil\\).",
    "For the base case \\(n=2\\), there is only one edge between two vertices, so a single color is sufficient.\n\nNow assume the result holds for tournaments on \\(n-1\\) vertices.

Therefore, no such red edge \\(e = u \\to v\\) with \\(u, v \\in S\\) exists.\n\nNow, consider the vertices in \\(V \\setminus S\\).

    "Since \\(S\\) has no red edges and \\(n/2\\) vertices, we can properly color the edges within \\(S\\) using \\(\\log_2(n/2)\\) colors by our induction hypothesis.

    "The proof by induction is complete. Therefore, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n$ vertices is $\\lceil\\log_2 n\\rceil$. This result follows from the construction provided and the inductive argument.\n\nIn the base case, when $n = 1$, a single vertex has no edges, so the minimum number of colors required is 1. For $n > 1$, the induction hypothesis assumes that the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n-1$ vertices is $\\lceil\\log_2 (n-1)\\rceil$. By the construction, we can add a new vertex $v$ and color its edges with the colors used for the vertices in the tournament on $n-1$ vertices, ensuring that no two edges have the same color. Since $\\lceil\\log_2 (n-1)\\rceil + 1 = \\lceil\\log_2 n\\rceil$, the result holds for $n$ as well.\n\nIn conclusion, the minimum directed-edge-chromatic-number of a tournament on $n$ vertices is $\\lceil\\log_2 n\\rceil$."

    "Let \\(P(x)\\) be the given polynomial. We want to show that \\(P(x)\\) has no real roots, but for any swap of coefficients \\(a_i, a_j\\), the resulting polynomial \\(Q(x)\\) has at least one real root.\n\nFirst, we show that \\(P(x)\\) has no real roots. Since all coefficients are positive, Descartes' Rule of Signs states that \\(P(x)\\) has at most 20 sign changes in its coefficients sequence. However, since all coefficients are positive, there are no sign changes, and thus \\(P(x)\\) has no real roots by the Descartes' Rule of Signs.\n\nNow, we show that for any swap of coefficients \\(a_i, a_j\\), the polynomial \\(Q(x)\\) has at least one real root. Let \\(i, j \\in \\{0, 1, \\ldots, 19\\}\\) with \\(i \\neq j\\). Without loss of generality, assume \\(i < j\\). The polynomial \\(Q(x)\\) can be written as:\n\n\\[Q(x) = x^{20} + a_jx^{19} + \\ldots + a_{i+1}x^{i+1} + a_ix^{i} + \\ldots + a_{j-1}x^{j-1} + a_{i}x^{i} + \\ldots + a_0\\]\n\nWe can factor out \\(x^i\\) from \\(Q(x)\\):\n\n\\[Q(x) = x^i(x^{19-i} + b_1x^{19-i-1} + \\ldots + b_{19-i} + c)\\]\n\nwhere \\(b_k = a_{i+k}/x^k\\) and \\(c = a_0/x^i + \\ldots + a_{i-1}/x^{i-1}\\). Since \\(a_k > 0\\) for all \\(k\\), we have \\(b_k > 0\\) for \\(k = 1, \\ldots, 19-i\\) and \\(c > 0\\). Therefore, \\(x^{19-i} + b_1x^{19-i-1} + \\ldots + b_{19-i} + c > 0\\) for all \\(x \\in \\mathbb{R}\\). Hence, \\(Q(x)\\) has at least one real root by the Factor Theorem, which states that a polynomial has a root at \\(x = -b_k\\) for any nonzero coefficient \\(b_k\\).\n\nThus, we have shown that \\(P(x)\\) has no real roots, but for any swap of coefficients \\(a_i, a_j\\), the resulting polynomial \\(Q(x)\\) has at least one real root.

    "To complete the proof, we need to show that for any permutation $\\sigma$, the polynomial $P_\\sigma(x)$ has at least one real root. Since $a_i > 0$ for all $i$, the Descartes rule of signs tells us that $P_\\sigma(x)$ can have at most $19$ sign changes in its coefficients.\n\nLet $r_1, r_2, \\dots, r_{19}$ be the roots of $P(x)$ (which do not exist by assumption).
