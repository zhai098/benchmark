    "Since the sum of all numbers from 1 to \\( p^2 \\) is \\( \\frac{p^2(p^2 + 1)}{2} \\), and each \\( a_i \\) and \\( b_j \\) represents the net effect of operations on each row and column, we have:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^p a_i + \\sum_{j=1}^p b_j = -p \\left( \\frac{p^2 + 1}{2} \\right).\n\\]\nThis implies:\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^p a_i = -\\frac{p(p^2 + 1)}{2} + \\sum_{j=1}^p b_j.\n\\]\nSince the total sum of the matrix elements is \\( \\frac{p^2(p^2 + 1)}{2} \\), the only way to achieve a sum of 0 for each element is if the operations balance out perfectly.

    "Since the sum of the numbers on the main diagonal \\( A_{11} + A_{22} + \\cdots + A_{pp} \\) is constant for all permutations \\(\\sigma \\in S_p\\), it must be equal to the sum of the first \\( p \\) natural numbers, which is \\(\\frac{p(p+1)}{2}\\).

    "Consider the following series of steps:\n1. Connect usamon \\(1\\) to usamon \\(2\\).\n2. Connect usamon \\(2\\) to usamon \\(3\\).\n3. Continue this process until usamon \\(2014\\) is connected to usamon \\(2015\\).\n\nAfter these connections, usamon \\(1\\) and usamon \\(2015\\) will be in the same state. This is because each connection transfers the electron from one usamon to the next in the sequence. If usamon \\(1\\) initially has an electron, it will eventually be transferred to usamon \\(2015\\) through the chain of connections. If usamon \\(1\\) does not have an electron, no electron will be transferred, and both usamon \\(1\\) and usamon \\(2015\\) will remain without an electron.

    "Consider the sum \\( S = \\sum_{i=1}^{2015} x_i \\).

However, \\( S \\) can take any even value between 0 and 2014 inclusive. The key observation is that \\( S \\) must be even, and since the physicist cannot determine the exact state of any usamon, she cannot ensure that \\( S \\) is exactly 0 or 2014 without additional information.\n\nThus, it is not possible for the physicist to guarantee that she can isolate two usamons that are in the same state using only the described operations.",
    "Define \\(x_i = 0\\) if usamon \\(i\\) has no electron and \\(x_i = 1\\) if it has an electron. **Lemma:** If there exists a permutation \\(\\sigma \\in S_n\\) such that the physicist's knowledge is exactly \\(x_{\\sigma(i)} = x_i\\) for all \\(i\\), then the physicist can isolate two usamons in the same state.\n\n**Proof:** Consider the permutation \\(\\sigma\\) that satisfies \\(x_{\\sigma(i)} = x_i\\). The physicist can connect the diode from usamon \\(i\\) to usamon \\(\\sigma(i)\\) for each \\(i\\). After all such connections, if usamon \\(i\\) has an electron, then usamon \\(\\sigma(i)\\) will also have an electron because the electron can only move from a usamon with an electron to a usamon without, and \\(\\sigma(i)\\) must have the same state as \\(i\\). Thus, after these connections, usamon \\(i\\) and usamon \\(\\sigma(i)\\) will be in the same state.\n\nTo construct such a permutation, note that if all usamons are in the same state, the identity permutation works. Otherwise, consider the connected components of the graph where vertices are usamons and edges are the diode connections. Each component must be either all 0s or all 1s. The physicist can always find such a permutation by mapping each component to itself. This ensures that the physicist can isolate two usamons in the same state.\n\nThus, the physicist can always achieve the goal.",
    "The lemma implies that the physicist can achieve a state where the usamons are ordered by their electron states. To isolate two usamons in the same state, the physicist can use the diode to repeatedly connect usamon \\(i\\) to usamon \\(i+1\\) for \\(i = 1, 2, \\ldots, 2014\\). This process will ensure that if \\(x_i = x_{i+1}\\) for some \\(i\\), the electron will eventually be transferred between them, making them both have either an electron or none. After performing these connections, the physicist can check the state of the first and the last usamon. If they are in the same state, the physicist has isolated two usamons that are sure to be in the same state. Therefore, the physicist can achieve the goal.",
    "To prove the lemma, consider firing a diode from usamon \\(A\\) to usamon \\(B\\).

If \\(x_A \\neq 1\\) or \\(x_B \\neq 0\\), no change occurs, and the order is preserved. Thus, the lemma holds.\n\nNow, consider the initial state of the usamons. If all usamons are in the same state, the physicist can immediately isolate two usamons in the same state. Otherwise, there exists at least one usamon with an electron and at least one without. By the lemma, the physicist can use the diode to ensure the state order is preserved. \n\nTo isolate two usamons in the same state, the physicist can repeatedly use the diode to move electrons from usamons with electrons to usamons without, ensuring the order \\(x_{\\sigma(1)} \\le x_{\\sigma(2)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{\\sigma(n)}\\) is maintained. Eventually, the physicist can ensure that the last usamon has an electron and all others do not, or vice versa.

    "To achieve the goal, the physicist needs to ensure that two usamons are in the same state. By the lemma, the physicist can only maintain the invariant that the charge distribution is non-decreasing under the firing of diodes. Therefore, the physicist should aim to make the charge distribution as uniform as possible.\n\nConsider the following strategy: the physicist can repeatedly fire diodes between the usamons in a pairwise manner, ensuring that the charge distribution remains non-decreasing. Specifically, for each \\(i\\) from 1 to 2014, the physicist fires a diode from usamon \\(i\\) to usamon \\(i+1\\) if \\(x_i < x_{i+1}\\). This process will eventually make the charge distribution non-decreasing and, if there is a majority state (either all usamons have an electron or all do not), it will isolate two usamons in the same state.\n\nAfter this process, if there is a majority state, the physicist will have two usamons in the same state. If there is no majority state, the physicist can still ensure that the charge distribution is non-decreasing, but no two usamons will be in the same state. However, the physicist can still conclude that two usamons are in the same state if the charge distribution is uniform.\n\nThus, the physicist can isolate two usamons that are sure to be in the same state by following the described strategy.",
    "To achieve the goal, the physicist needs to ensure that two usamons are in the same state. By the lemma, firing a diode does not change the fact that the physicist's knowledge is ordered as \\( x_{\\sigma(1)} \\le x_{\\sigma(2)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{\\sigma(2015)} \\). Therefore, the physicist should aim to create a situation where two usamons are at the same position in the ordered sequence.\n\nThe physicist can achieve this by repeatedly firing diodes between usamons in such a way that the sequence becomes monotonic. Specifically, the physicist can start by firing diodes between usamons 1 and 2, then between 2 and 3, and so on, until the sequence is either all 0s or all 1s. This process ensures that the physicist can isolate two usamons that are in the same state.\n\nIf the sequence is all 0s, then usamons 1 and 2 are both 0. If the sequence is all 1s, then usamons 2015 and 2014 are both 1. In either case, the physicist has isolated two usamons that are in the same state.\n\nThus, the physicist can achieve the goal by repeatedly firing diodes in the described manner.",
    "If \\(\\sigma'\\) is a permutation such that \\(\\sigma'(j) = \\sigma(i)\\) and \\(\\sigma'(i) = \\sigma(j)\\), and otherwise \\(\\sigma'(x) = \\sigma(x)\\), then the physicist's information is of the form \\(x_{\\sigma'(1)} \\le x_{\\sigma'(2)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{\\sigma'(n)}\\). Therefore, firing a diode does not change the fact that the physicist's knowledge is of the form \\(x_{\\sigma(1)} \\le x_{\\sigma(2)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{\\sigma(n)}\\).\n\nTo isolate two usamons that are sure to be in the same state, the physicist can use the diode to create a chain where each usamon \\(i\\) is connected to usamon \\(i+1\\) for \\(1 \\le i < 2015\\). This ensures that the states of all usamons are the same after all possible electron transfers, as any electron that could have moved would have done so, and the physicist's knowledge would be of the form \\(x_1 = x_2 = \\cdots = x_{2015}\\).\n\nThus, the physicist can isolate any two usamons, say usamon 1 and usamon 2015, and be sure that they are in the same state.",
    "By the lemma, the physicist's knowledge can be represented by a non-decreasing sequence of \\(0\\)s and \\(1\\)s. The goal is to isolate two usamons in the same state. Suppose the physicist's knowledge is represented by the sequence \\(0, 0, \\ldots, 0, 1, 1, \\ldots, 1\\). The physicist can achieve this by repeatedly firing diodes between usamons in the same state or between usamons in different states. Specifically, the physicist can pair up all usamons with \\(0\\)s and all usamons with \\(1\\)s, firing diodes within each pair to ensure that all usamons with \\(0\\)s are in the same state and all usamons with \\(1\\)s are in the same state. This can be done by firing diodes between any usamon with \\(0\\) and any usamon with \\(1\\), which will not change the fact that the sequence remains non-decreasing. Once all usamons are paired, the physicist can be sure that two usamons in the same state (either both \\(0\\) or both \\(1\\)) can be isolated.\n\nThus, the physicist can indeed isolate two usamons that she is sure are currently in the same state.",

If such a permutation exists, the physicist can isolate two usamons with the same state. Consider the permutation \\(\\sigma\\) defined by the sorted indices of the usamons based on their electron states. Since there are only two states (0 or 1), the sorted permutation will have at most two distinct values. Therefore, there must exist indices \\(i\\) and \\(j\\) such that \\(x_{\\sigma(i)} = x_{\\sigma(j)}\\). This means that the physicist can isolate usamons \\(\\sigma(i)\\) and \\(\\sigma(j)\\) with the same state by using the diode operations as described in the lemma.\n\nThus, the physicist can indeed isolate two usamons that are sure to be in the same state.",
    "This implies that if the physicist has information of the form\n\\[ x_{\\sigma(1)} \\le x_{\\sigma(2)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{\\sigma(n)}, \\]\nthen firing a diode does not change this fact. Therefore, the physicist can only gain information about the relative order of the usamons' electron states. \n\nConsider the case where all usamons have the same state (either all have an electron or none have an electron). In this scenario, the physicist's information is always of the form\n\\[ 1 \\le 1 \\le \\cdots \\le 1 \\quad \\text{or} \\quad 0 \\le 0 \\le \\cdots \\le 0. \\]\n\nNow, consider the case where exactly one usamon has an electron. The physicist's information would be of the form\n\\[ 0 \\le 0 \\le \\cdots \\le 1 \\le 0 \\le \\cdots \\le 0. \\]\n\nIn both of these scenarios, the physicist cannot determine with certainty that two specific usamons are in the same state, as the relative order does not change regardless of the diode firings. Therefore, the physicist cannot isolate two usamons that she is sure are currently in the same state using the given tool.\n\nThus, the answer is that there is no series of diode usage that makes this possible.",
    "This implies that if the physicist has information\n\\[ x_{\\sigma(1)} \\le x_{\\sigma(2)} \\le \\cdots \\le x_{\\sigma(n)}, \\]\nthen firing a diode does not change this fact. Therefore, the physicist can only gain information about the relative order of the usamons' electron states but cannot determine the exact states of any two usamons with certainty.

Therefore, it is impossible for the physicist to isolate two usamons that she is sure are in the same state.\n\nThus, the physicist cannot achieve her goal.",

However, each pair is counted twice (once for each point in the pair), so the number of harmonic pairs is:\n\n\\[\n\\frac{10 \\times 10 \\times 3}{2} = 150\n\\]\n\nThis configuration can be extended to cover the 100 points by considering a 10x10 grid and ensuring that the points are placed such that the distance condition is satisfied. Since the grid can be tiled to cover 100 points, the maximum number of harmonic pairs remains the same as in the 10x10 grid.\n\nThus, the maximum number of harmonic pairs among 100 points is \\(\\boxed{150}\\).",

The transformed distance is \\(d'(A', B') = |x_1' - x_2'| + |y_1' - y_2'|\\). For \\(d(A, B)\\) to be in the range \\(1 < d(A, B) \\leq 2\\), \\(d'(A', B')\\) must be in the range \\(1 < d'(A', B') \\leq 2\\).\n\nEach point \\(P\\) in the original coordinate system corresponds to a unique point \\(P'\\) in the rotated coordinate system.

    "Consider a graph \\( G' \\) consisting of three copies of \\( G \\). Each copy of \\( G \\) has an independent set of size 6.

Repeating this process, we eventually reach a subgraph with at most 6 vertices, all of which must be connected to at least one of the remaining vertices, contradicting the assumption that there is no \\( K_5 \\) subgraph and the independent set size is less than 6.\n\nThus, the maximum \\( k \\) such that for all such possible configurations, there exists \\( k \\) students who are all not friends is \\( \\boxed{6} \\).",

Removing the 7 vertices of the independent set from \\( H \\) leaves a subgraph with 23 vertices. Each of these 23 vertices has at most 5 neighbors, so the maximum degree in this subgraph is 5.

Therefore, \\( k \\leq 6 \\).\n\nCombining both inequalities, we have \\( k = 6 \\).",
    "To show that any such graph must have an independent set of at least size 6, we use the fact that the graph is \\( K_5 \\)-free and regular with degree 5. By the pigeonhole principle, any set of 5 vertices must contain at least one pair of non-adjacent vertices. We can iteratively select such pairs to form an independent set. Starting with any vertex, we can select at most 5 vertices in the first round, and then at least one more in the second round, ensuring that the total number of vertices in the independent set is at least 6. Thus, the maximum \\( k \\) such that for all such possible configurations, there exists \\( k \\) students who are all not friends is \\( \\boxed{6} \\).",
    "By Turán's Theorem, for a graph with 30 vertices and maximum degree 5, the maximum number of edges is achieved by a Turán graph \\( T(30, 6) \\), which is a complete 6-partite graph with each part having 5 vertices. In \\( T(30, 6) \\), each vertex has exactly 20 neighbors, contradicting the condition that each vertex has at most 5 friends.

Since our graph \\( G' \\) has at most 180 edges, it must have at least 300 - 180 = 120 edges, matching \\( T(30, 4) \\). The Turán graph \\( T(30, 4) \\) is a 6-regular graph and has an independent set of size 6. Therefore, any graph satisfying the given conditions must have an independent set of size at least 6. Since we have constructed a graph with an independent set of size 6, the maximum \\( k \\) is indeed 6.",
    "Since \\( \\overline{G} \\) does not contain a \\( K_6 \\), by Turán's Theorem, \\( \\overline{G} \\) has at most \\( \\left\\lfloor \\frac{30^2}{2 \\cdot 6} \\right\\rfloor = 75 \\) edges.

Therefore, the set \\(\\{g_{\\mathcal{U}}(Q) : Q \\in \\mathcal{U}\\}\\) for any set of 120 points on the boundary of a unit square is a closed interval that intersects with every other such interval. Hence, there exists a real number \\( t \\) such that for any set of 120 points on the boundary of a unit square, there is a point \\( Q \\) with \\( |P_1Q| + |P_2Q| + \\cdots + |P_{120}Q| = t \\).\n\nThe value of \\( t \\) is the average of the sums of distances from any point on the boundary to all 120 points, which is \\( 120 \\times 2 = 240 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{240}\n\\]",

    "By the given conditions, we know that for any open arc $\\Gamma$ of length $\\pi$ on $C$, there are at most $200$ of $j$ such that $z_j \\in \\Gamma$. This implies that the points $z_j$ are distributed such that no $\\pi$-arc contains more than $200$ points. Similarly, for any open arc $\\gamma$ of length $\\pi/3$, there are at most $120$ of $j$ such that $z_j \\in \\gamma$.\n\nConsider the sum $S = z_1 + z_2 + \\cdots + z_{240}$. To maximize $|S|$, we need to consider the geometric arrangement of the points on the unit circle. The conditions imply that the points are spread out, but not too much. Specifically, if we divide the circle into $6$ arcs of length $\\pi/3$, each arc can contain at most $120$ points. This suggests a balanced distribution.\n\nBy the pigeonhole principle, if we divide the circle into $6$ arcs of length $\\pi/3$, each arc can contain at most $120$ points. The maximum $|S|$ is achieved when the points are as evenly distributed as possible. In this case, the sum of the points can be maximized by having $120$ points in each of two opposite arcs and $0$ points in the other four arcs. This configuration gives us:\n\\[ S = 120 \\cdot 1 + 120 \\cdot (-1) = 0. \\]\n\nHowever, a more balanced configuration would be to have $120$ points in one arc and $120$ points in the opposite arc, each contributing $\\frac{1}{2}$ to the sum on average. This gives:\n\\[ S = 120 \\cdot \\frac{1}{2} + 120 \\cdot \\left(-\\frac{1}{2}\\right) = 0. \\]\n\nThe maximum possible value of $|S|$ is achieved when the points are distributed such that the sum of the real parts is maximized. This can be done by having $120$ points on the positive real axis and $120$ points on the negative real axis, which gives:\n\\[ S = 120 \\cdot 1 + 120 \\cdot (-1) = 0. \\]\n\nHowever, the maximum value of $|S|$ is actually achieved when the points are distributed such that the sum of the real parts is maximized, which is:\n\\[ |S| = 120. \\]\n\nThus, the maximum of $|z_1 + z_2 + \\cdots + z_{240}|$ is \\(\\boxed{120}\\).",
    "By the pigeonhole principle, for any open arc $\\Gamma$ of length $\\pi/3$ on $C$, there are at least $20$ of $j$ such that $z_j \\in \\Gamma$. Consider the 120 arcs of length $\\pi/3$ that partition the unit circle. Each arc contains at least 20 of the $z_j$. Summing the contributions of these arcs, we get at least $120 \\cdot 20 = 2400$ instances of $z_j$.\n\nNow, consider the sum $S = z_1 + z_2 + \\ldots + z_{240}$. The sum of the roots of unity over a full circle is zero. We can partition the unit circle into 120 arcs of length $\\pi/3$. For each arc, the sum of the $z_j$ in that arc is bounded by the number of terms times the maximum magnitude of $z_j$, which is 1. Thus, the total sum of all $z_j$ can be bounded by the number of arcs times the maximum number of terms per arc, which is 200.\n\nUsing the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality, we have:\n\\[\n|S|^2 \\leq 240 \\sum_{j=1}^{240} |z_j|^2 = 240 \\cdot 240 = 57600.\n\\]\nThus,\n\\[\n|S| \\leq \\sqrt{57600} = 240.\n\\]\n\nTo achieve this bound, we need to distribute the $z_j$ such that each arc of length $\\pi/3$ contains exactly 20 $z_j$. This can be done by placing 20 $z_j$ on each of the 12 arcs of length $\\pi/3$, ensuring that no arc of length $\\pi$ contains more than 200 $z_j$.

    "To find the least positive integer \\( d_n \\) which cannot be expressed in the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}}\\), we first observe that each term \\((-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}}\\) is either \\(2^{b_{i}}\\) or \\(-2^{b_{i}}\\). This means that the expression can be interpreted as a sum of powers of 2 with coefficients \\(\\pm 1\\).\n\nWe claim that \\( d_n = 2^{n+1} - 1 \\) is the least positive integer that cannot be expressed in this form. We will prove this by induction on \\( n \\).\n\n**Base Case:** For \\( n = 1 \\), the possible values are \\( 2^0 = 1 \\) and \\( -2^0 = -1 \\). Clearly, 2 cannot be expressed in this form, so \\( d_1 = 2 \\).\n\n**Inductive Step:** Assume that for some \\( n \\), the least positive integer that cannot be expressed in the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}}\\) is \\( 2^{n+1} - 1 \\). We need to show that \\( 2^{n+2} - 1 \\) is the least positive integer that cannot be expressed in the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}}\\).\n\nConsider the set of integers that can be expressed using \\( n+1 \\) terms. Any integer in this set can be written as \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}}\\). Notice that any integer in the range from \\( -2^{n+1} + 1 \\) to \\( 2^{n+1} - 1 \\) can be expressed using \\( n \\) terms. Adding another term \\( \\pm 2^{n+1} \\) allows us to cover the range from \\( -2^{n+2} + 1 \\) to \\( 2^{n+2} - 1 \\). Therefore, the integers from \\( -2^{n+2} + 1 \\) to \\( 2^{n+2} - 1 \\) can be expressed using \\( n+1 \\) terms. The integer \\( 2^{n+2} \\) cannot be expressed in this form because it is outside the range that can be covered by adding \\( 2^{n+1} \\) to the range from \\( -2^{n+1} + 1 \\) to \\( 2^{n+1} - 1 \\).\n\nThus, the least positive integer that cannot be expressed in the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n+1}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}}\\) is \\( 2^{n+2} - 1 \\).\n\nBy induction, the least positive integer \\( d_n \\) which cannot be expressed in the form \\(\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}}\\) is \\( 2^{n+1} - 1 \\).\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{2^{n+1} - 1}\n\\]",
    "We claim that \\( d_n = 2^n \\).\n\nTo prove this, we first show that all integers less than \\( 2^n \\) can be expressed in the desired form. Consider the binary representation of an integer \\( k \\) with \\( n \\) or fewer bits. We can express \\( k \\) as a sum of distinct powers of 2, and by changing the sign of each term, we can achieve the desired form. For example, \\( 13 = 2^3 + 2^2 + 2^0 \\) can be written as \\( (-1)^0 2^3 + (-1)^1 2^2 + (-1)^0 2^0 \\).\n\nNext, we show that \\( 2^n \\) cannot be expressed in the desired form. Suppose \\( 2^n \\) can be written as\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}}.\n\\]\nSince the sum must equal \\( 2^n \\), there must be at least one term with \\( 2^n \\). Without loss of generality, assume \\( b_1 = n \\). Then the equation becomes\n\\[\n2^n + \\sum_{i=2}^{n}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}} = 2^n,\n\\]\nwhich simplifies to\n\\[\n\\sum_{i=2}^{n}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}} = 0.\n\\]\nThe left-hand side is a sum of distinct powers of 2 with alternating signs, and the only way this can sum to zero is if all terms cancel out. However, since \\( 2^n \\) is the largest term and all other terms are smaller, it is impossible for the sum to be zero unless all other terms are zero, which is not possible with distinct powers of 2.\n\nTherefore, \\( 2^n \\) cannot be expressed in the desired form, and the least positive integer \\( d_n \\) is \\( 2^n \\).",

Suppose, for the sake of contradiction, that \\( 2^n \\) can be expressed as\n\\[\n2^n = \\sum_{i=1}^{n}(-1)^{a_{i}}2^{b_{i}}.\n\\]\nSince the sum of the terms on the right-hand side is \\( 2^n \\), the sum of the terms with \\( (-1)^{a_i} = 1 \\) must equal the sum of the terms with \\( (-1)^{a_i} = -1 \\) plus \\( 2^n \\).

Therefore, the sum of the terms with \\( (-1)^{a_i} = 1 \\) cannot be \\( 2^n \\), leading to a contradiction.\n\nThus, \\( 2^n \\) cannot be expressed in the desired form, and the least positive integer \\( d_n \\) that cannot be expressed in this form is \\( 2^n \\).\n\n\\(\\blacksquare\\)",

Then, we have\n\\[\nk = \\sum_{i=0}^{n} (-1)^{a_i} 2^i.\n\\]\nSince \\( k < 2^{n+1} - 2 \\), the binary representation of \\( k \\) has at most \\( n+1 \\) digits, and the last digit is 1. Therefore, we can include \\( 2^n \\) in the sum by setting \\( b_n = n \\) and \\( b_i = i \\) for \\( i < n \\).

By choosing \\( m \\) and \\( h \\) appropriately, we can ensure that the snake zigzags through the grid and has a length approaching \\( 0.9n^2 \\).\n\nThe snake can be reversed by a series of moves that involve wrapping around the grid and forming reversed blocks (R-blocks) at the top of the grid. Specifically, the snake can be moved to the top of the grid, then reversed by moving it back down through the grid, effectively turning around.\n\nBy choosing \\( m \\) and \\( h \\) such that the snake length is at least \\( 0.9n^2 \\), we can guarantee that the snake can turn around. This is possible because the grid size \\( n \\) is sufficiently large to accommodate the snake and the necessary moves for reversal.\n\nThus, there exists an integer \\( n > 1 \\) such that a snake of length \\( 0.9n^2 \\) can turn around in an \\( n \\times n \\) grid.",
